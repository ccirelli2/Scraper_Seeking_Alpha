Brian Beckwith
Welcome to our fiscal year 2009 first quarter earnings conference call. I’ll begin with a brief overview of our results and then cover some important financial and operational highlights and then Mike DeMarco, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss our financial results in more detail.
The first fiscal quarter has historically been the largest and most profitable quarter for Peoples Education. While our revenue declined slightly from the same period in the prior year, we’re please to report double-digit growths in net income, non-GAAP net income and free cash flow which we’ll detail later and give you more detail later in the conversation.
Overall our revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2008 was $16 million, down 5% versus the same period in the prior year. Test Preparation, Assessment and Instruction revenue declined 9.5% to $6.7 million while College Preparation decreased 1.8% to $9.3 million.
According to the Association of American Publishers, the AAP market conditions in the supplemental segment of the educational publishing industry continued to be challenging, while the basal or textbook market has fared somewhat better.
Historically supplemental revenue suffers when educators are focusing on the purchase of basal textbooks. Supplemental revenue was off 10.5% for the calendar year to-date in the 22 adoption states where text books are chosen at the state level and of 9.3% for the same period in the non-adoption states, for an overall decline of 9.9%.
While educational budgets tend to be the last to be cut during times of state and local physical stress, they are not immune. According to a recent report from the national association of state budget officer\'s website, at least 29 states faced budget shortfalls in fiscal year 2009 which begins July 1, 2008 in most states. Two major states, California and Florida have had to make significant cuts in spending in the current fiscal year.
Yet despite softness in supplemental material sales, our internal analysis of publicly available information in the Test Preparation segment of the supplemental market indicates that this specific part of the market is continuing to grow and we expect it to fair better than more general instructional materials during the downturn in state and local spending.
People’s Education grew at a steady pace through the last fiscal state crisis in the years 2002 to 2004. We feel that the current fiscal problems may have moderated our growth, but we’ve continued to gain share in the overall supplemental market and feel we will be well positioned when the funding improves.

Having invested in a development of a strong standard space content database in Test Preparation lessons and assessment, we feel we are well-positioned to leverage that content into new states, as well as new segments in the Test Preparation market such as Measuring Up Express which is our new lower cost, less comprehensive print series, in a timely and efficient manner. This leveraging of existing content extends to digital instruction as well, which I’ll touch on in a moment.
We’ve been extremely pleased with the results of our Measuring Up products in California. We continue to show strong growth in the state as a result of our selection by the California Department of Education as the top-ranked print and electronic intervention program for their $5.5 million high school exit exam adoption. The credibility and brand recognition that the state high school adoption brought us has translated into revenue on non-high school products as well.
On the electronic product front, our user-friendly yet highly capable online assessment diagnostic system, e-Path, was critical to our success with last year’s California adoption. Developed in conjunction with the Cisco Learning Institute, e-Path has begun to experience significant growth in our other major states. In two major districts in Texas, we’ve begun to offer digital instruction, which students can access as a direct result of their work with the e-Path assessment system, which identifies their strengths and weaknesses.
Our e-Path online assessment revenue for the quarter is up substantially on a year-over-year basis. We believe that providing digital instruction as well as assessment will be a key part of our strategy over the next several years as the market continues to move towards Electronic Preparation and Instruction for state tests. We are in the process of developing digital instructional capabilities and now intend to implement private lessons in two states during the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
If these products are successful, we’ll finalize the development of a digital instruction product and test market this product in two of our key states. Instruction will be driven by our e-Path assessment system, which once again is designed to identify weaknesses relative to the state standards and specific grades and subject areas, including English language, arts, math and science.
Focused Instruction product line revenue was up 17% on a year-over-year basis in the face of a supplemental market in which many competitors are faced with significantly declining revenues. Late in the first quarter of this year, in time for the new school year, we published Turbo Math for the middle school grades six through eight. We now have the Turbo Math product for grades three through eight.
In addition based on request from educators, we also released an earlier grade, AB, sort of first and second grade for the Keep on Reading-Science series. We now offer six Focused Instruction series, each of which comes with free online assessment, pretests and post-tests, delivered by our e-Path platform.
We plan to continue to invest in the development of new Focused Instruction products and to offer them in combination for intervention programs at the district level. We recently exhibited at the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, called ASCD for the first time in our history and received the strong reception for our newly created intervention programs in reading and math, including intervention kits with customized pacing guides developed from our growing line of Focused Instruction products.
I’ll now turn it over to Mike to discuss our financials in more detail. 
Mike DeMarco
As Brian had indicated earlier, revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2008 was $16 million representing a 5% decline from the prior year. Testing, Assessment and Instruction product line revenue was $6.7 million and College Preparation product line revenue was $9.3 million, representing declines of 9.5% and 1.8% respectively from the prior year.

Within the Testing, Assessment and Instruction product group, testing revenue for the quarter was down 10%, while Focused Instruction and electronic product revenue increased 17% and 24% respectively on a year-over-year basis. Cost of revenue for the quarter was $10.1 million, 62.9% of revenue, compared to $10.4 million, 61.7% of revenue in the prior year.
Cost of revenue consists of two compounds; direct cost and prepublication cost of amortization. Direct costs consists of (1) product cost, which includes paper, printing and binding, and prepress costs for proprietary products and product purchases for nonproprietary products; (2) royalties on proprietary products; and (3) warehousing and shipping costs on all products.
Direct costs as a percentage of revenue was 52.6%, an increase from 51.6% last year. The percentage increase is primarily due to revenue mix, as College Preparation revenue increased from 54.6% of total revenue last year to 58.4% this year. College Preparation direct costs are substantially higher than our other products as they primarily consist of non-proprietary products.
Prepublication costs include one-time expenses associated with developing and producing new and revised proprietary products. For the quarter, we amortize $1.7 million of prepublication costs, which is consistent with the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $3.6 million, a decline of $539,000 from last year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses decreased from 24.5% last year to 22.4% this year.
Selling and Marketing expenses within SG&A decreased from 17.3% of revenue last year to 14% as we continue to closely control costs. General and Administrative expenses for the quarter were $1.3 million, an increase of $126,000 from the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter was 228,000, a decrease of a 160,000 from the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to lower average outstanding debt. 
Net income for the quarter was $1.3 million; an increase of 13.8% and earnings per share was $0.30, an increase of $0.04 from the prior year. Non-GAAP net income, which adjusts for the difference between pre-publication expenditures and amortization, was $1.5 million, an improvement of 24.5% from the prior year. On a per share basis it increased from $0.28 to $0.34.
The company’s liquidity and capital resources continue to improve as free cash flow for the quarter was $4.3 million, an improvement of $1 million from the prior year. In addition at August 31, 2008 we had outstanding debt of $11.8 million which represents a decrease of $2.1 million from August 31, 2007.
Brian Beckwith
I’d like to close our prepared remarks with just a few comments on Peoples Education’s outlook for fiscal year 2009. In fiscal year 2008 we achieved modest revenue growth, but substantial improvements in non-GAAP net income and free cash flow through operating efficiencies and process improvements. We expect this trend to continue for fiscal 2009. 
In fiscal 2009, we expect continued revenue growth, so modestly given the economic environment and we’ll continue to focus on substantial improvements in non-GAAP net income and free cash flow, while continuing to reduce our outstanding debt.
In light of our first quarter earnings results and our expectations for improved revenue growth over the balance of fiscal 2009, we’re maintaining our fiscal 2009 financial guidance that we first provided in August. We project revenue to be between $41 million and $43 million; net income to be $600,000 to $1 million or $0.13 to $0.22 per basic share; and non-GAAP net income to be between $1.3 million and $1.8 million or $0.29 to $0.40 per basic share. In addition, we expect positive free cash flow to range between $1.5 million to $2 million. 

Thanks for listening to our prepared remarks. We’d now like to open it up for questions if any from our listening audience.
Question-and-Answer Session 

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sally Wallick - Dutton Associates.
Sally Wallick - Dutton Associates
Since you’ve maintained your guidance obviously you feel there are some revenue opportunities during the balance of the year. Could you talk about that? At some point, the revenue is going to turn up to achieve your targets and I’m just curious where that’s going to be and what’s going to drive it?
Brian Beckwith
Yes and Mike you can add more details if you would like, but it’s primarily new product introductions that we think will drive it. We just introduced the middle school Turbo Math as well as another grade of Keep on Reading-Science and it takes time for those sales to build. You tend not to sell very much in the first quarter actually; you’re out there selling it and showing the product for the first time, so we expect to see some improvements in that.
We are continuing a relatively aggressive publishing program on both the print and the electronic front. We have what we’ve cut back as you know pretty significantly on our prepublication expenses. We have not cut back on the number of products that we’ve added to the marketplace. So, we’re continuing to rollout with the Measuring Up Express selectively in states where research shows that we still has potential. We are continuing to upgrade and update Measuring Up products in our existing states and that’s where we feel we’ll see some revenue growth in the second half of the year. 
We also have some pretty aggressive marketing programs in place for our Focused Instruction product that we feel will get some traction. So, we are not expecting it to be a very good environment, I mean that’s the reality; that’s just going to be part and parcel of the economic environment that we’re operating in.
September and August rather was a very soft month industry wide across both basal and supplemental, so we know that we will be operating in a tough environment, but we’re prepared for it and we feel that our revenue growth projections are still relatively modest on a full-year basis and that the new products, coupled with continued improvement in sales force and marketing efforts is what’s going to deliver them.
Mike DeMarco
I think on the new products as Brain just mentioned; the Turbo Math and the Keep on Reading-Science AB. Yes Brain, as you’ve mentioned also the Measuring Up Express, with the rolling of that, that’s only been about three months in some of the newer states and I think we’re anticipating in some of the states that we just recently rolled out in to get some additional revenue boost there. 
Lastly, I mean although it isn’t locked down, there was a very large sale last year in the first quarter; about $325,000 that we’re still anticipating that we’re going to get, but it looks like it was going to slip into the second quarter. So, I mean we don’t have the purchase order for that yet, but everything still looks very positive about that and that’s a sizable sale just in itself.
Sally Wallick - Dutton Associates
Okay and Measuring Up Express, you’ve rolled it out into some new states this year, is that correct and if so, what are they?
Mike DeMarco
The most recent state was New Jersey. We do have another state that it’s being rolled out in, but we can’t disclose that at this point Sally because the books have not actually been published yet, but we also have it in Illinois and in Ohio, so it’s three states is total and one is pending very shortly.
Sally Wallick - Dutton Associates
Okay and could you just go over again and maybe give us a little more color on the digital instruction capability that you talked about? What’s the timetable on that again and what are the opportunities with that product?

Brian Beckwith
We’ve gotten feedback from educators and particularly in districts that are more technologically capable, that they would like to see instructions delivered electronically, digitally. There are districts that just flat out don’t use workbooks anymore and so that’s a growth opportunity for us, because that’s incremental business, if we can get into those markets and into those districts. 
We’ve begun to do that with some relatively unsophisticated digital product just putting up our books, PDF, but we’re now working on developing more sophisticated digital instructional program that will link from assessment directly into instructions, so the students will be able to have their weaknesses and strength diagnosed and the intervention will be delivered to them electronically, digitally, as is appropriate for their personal individual needs.
In terms of the timetable, we’re looking to pilot that in a couple of states in the next quarter and get feedback from educators and this is a software development project. So, we want to be cautious about it and we want to make sure that its thoroughly beta tested before we rollout with it, but we’re picking a couple of states where we have strong sales forces and we have people in those states to understand technology on the sales side. 
Our idea is to measure the reception in those districts that are most technologically advanced; to be certain that we feel we can deliver incremental revenues and not just replace print revenues or if we do replace print revenues, replace them at a higher margin and then we’ve been experiencing, so that’s where we are with that.
We took a similar approach with e-Path in terms of being very cautious about making sure that we had a product that was well bedded not only internally, but by the marketplace. So, we will do class room testing and we have this very strong panel of educators who work with us as advisors and then once we feel confident that the market opportunity is there and that we’re delivering it in an appropriate way, we’ll be positioned to roll fairly quickly with it; so that’s where we are.
Sally Wallick - Dutton Associates
Does the pilot testing process take this fiscal year and it’s more likely to be next year that you’re doing that aggressive rollout of this?
Brian Beckwith
Yes, that’s correct. We’re not really anticipating significant revenues this year.
Sally Wallick - Dutton Associates
Okay and then a final question; I continue to be impressed by your expense control and it seems like an extended period of time. What’s the outlook for the balance of the year; I mean total operating expenses were down I think 13% year-over-year in the first quarter. Can you keep that up during the balance of the year? Was there anything unusual in there in the first quarter relative to a year ago?
Mike DeMarco
No Sally, there really wasn’t. They were not anticipating quite that type of reduction for the balance of the year, but we’re going through and looking into details on that. We were pretty much comparing apples-to-apples; there was nothing that was in one quarter this year that wasn’t in the quarter last year and really it’s just the fruits of the labor that we’ve been working so hard on to maximize the resources and do things more efficiently, not only on the sales side, but on the marketing side and all across the company. 
So, it’s something that I’m constantly looking at and looking for ways that we can do things differently than the way we’ve done it in the past and to keep our cost structure down as well as we possibly can and it’s even more important in these times that we’re in, that where the state budgets are tough and revenue is tough and we need to monitor our costs and that’s really what we’ve been doing.

Brian Beckwith
Yes, it’s not something that we turned on a dime and began this program over a year ago and have worked through it successfully. I mean obviously our concept here is to continue to grow this business well while reducing our expenses, so that’s our objective and that’s what we intended to do.
