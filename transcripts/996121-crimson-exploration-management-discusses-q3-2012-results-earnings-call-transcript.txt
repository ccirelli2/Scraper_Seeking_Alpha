Good day, and welcome to the Crimson Exploration Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today\'s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\'d like to turn the conference over to Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Joe Grady. Please go ahead, sir.
E. Joseph Grady
Thank you, Robin, and welcome, everybody, to the Crimson Exploration Earnings Call for the Third Quarter 2012. On the agenda today, I will give you an overview of the financial results. I\'ll turn it over to Allan Keel, our President and CEO, to give you an overview of our operations. And then, we\'ll follow-up with the Q&A session.
We also have with us today, Tommy Atkins, our Senior VP of Exploration, to contribute on the discussion on the Q&A side. But before we get started, I want to remind everyone that the earnings release and the related discussion this morning may contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That include comments and assumptions concerning Crimson\'s strategic plans, expectations and objectives for future operations. Such statements are based on assumptions we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. However, those statements are just estimates, are not guarantees of future performance or results and therefore, should be considered in that context.
Starting with the financial results. Our net income loss for the quarter was a $3.8 million loss compared to net income of $527,000 in the prior-year quarter. If you exclude a $2.3 million pretax credit lease operating expenses in 2011 that was related to change in accrual methodology, noncash items in both periods for unrealized mark-to-market hedging gains and noncash impairment expense on unimproved leases for both periods, we would\'ve reflected net income of approximately $200,000 in the current quarter compared to a net loss of a little under $600,000 for the 2011 quarter.
On the cash flow side, adjusted EBITDAX, as we have defined in our release, was $21.6 million for the current quarter compared to $22.4 million for the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow, which is adjusted EBITDAX less interest expense, was $15.2 million or $0.34 per basic share for the current quarter, compared to $16.4 million or $0.36 per basic share in 2011.
While cash flow was relatively flat period-over-period, it is important to note that approximately 80% of our current quarter revenue came from liquids and -- oil and liquids production compared to about 50% in 2011, an improvement due to our shift to drilling oil and liquids weighted projects in early 2012.
On the production side, production for the quarter averaged 38.8 million equivalents a day compared to 45.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Though quarterly production decreased on an equivalent basis, crude oil and natural gas liquids production increased 49% quarter-over-quarter, to an average of 3,255 barrels per day in the 2012 quarter.
Furthermore, as you saw in our release, the company achieved a quarterly production ratio for oil and liquids as a percentage of total slightly in excess of 50%, compared to 29% in the 2011 quarter. And as we\'ve said all along, during the year, our goal for the year was to reach that. And so through that third quarter, we were -- we have been able to obtain that production level.

Guidance for the fourth quarter, as you saw, is a range of 34 million to 37 million a day, which is a slight decline from the current quarter due to the fact that we only have 1 new well coming on in the fourth quarter, and then new drilling in the Woodbine is scheduled to resume in early December when we get the rig back from a private operator that we subcontracted to back in the early part of the quarter.
As far as drilling going forward, we do expect to have that rig that we get in December active in our Madison and Grimes area for all of 2013.
On commodity prices, fuel prices for natural gas liquids and natural gas were down 41% and 33%, respectively, while oil prices were relatively flat. An important fact to note is that approximately 90% of our oil production does receive an LLS premium, resulting in a net price to us of approximately WTI plus $6 to $10 a barrel, depending on what the LLS premium is for any particular month.
Hedging commodity price risk continues to be a part of our strategy. As you saw, we added some hedges for the quarter -- or after the end of the quarter. And looking forward to 2013, we\'ve currently got about 50% of our forecasted PDP production for natural gas and crude, and the heaviest portion of our liquids hedged at pretty attractive prices. And we\'ll continue to be opportunistic in adding to that as we go forward.
Direct lease operating expenses, including expense workovers, were $3.3 million or $0.93 per Mcfe for the quarter compared to $900,000 or $0.22 per Mcfe in the 2011 quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the 2011 quarter reflected a change in accrual methodology, which resulted in a $2.3 million pretax credit to LOE in the 2011 quarter. Exclusive of this adjustment, quarter-over-quarter LOE expenses were comparable.
As you noticed in the release, guidance for the fourth quarter 2012 is $4.2 million to $4.5 million, a forecasted increase due to expected workover expenses in the fourth quarter.
During the third quarter 2012, we invested about $14 million in our capital program, and that consisted primarily of drilling and completion operations in the Woodbine formation in Madison and Grimes Counties, Texas.
Also included a successful sidetrack of the conventional Catherine Henderson A-6 well in Liberty County. Year-to-date, Crimson has invested approximately $74 million in its capital program, which in total, is forecasted to be approximately $80 million for the year.
That concludes the financial review. Now I will turn it over to Allan for an operations update.
Allan D. Keel
Thanks, Joe, and thanks for everyone joining us this morning. While this quarter was a little bit slower than the first half of the year as our CapEx and our production declined slightly, we did continue to make good progress in our transformation from a predominantly natural gas-oriented company to a more balanced production-base with liquids and some oil in there as well.
We achieved our goal, a full year of attaining a production profile of 50% oil and liquids, and we\'re very pleased with that. We do have a very good inventory of oil and liquids rich opportunities that will continue to develop as we go forward, given the current state of the commodity markets.
We do have -- we do continue to have our inventory of natural gas projects, primarily in our Haynesville/Mid-Bossier acreage. But again, we will focus on our liquids and oil projects as we move forward.
As you saw during our releases during the quarter, we\'ve been -- our primary focus here has been Madison Grimes County where we\'ve been pursuing those -- the Woodbine formation primarily. Again, there\'s other activity in and around us up there that make us feel very confident about the other formations that may be productive there, including the Eagle Ford and the Georgetown.

Earlier this year, we put our first Woodbine well on, that was back in April. We\'ve drawn our production up there to over 1,100 barrels a day equivalent net to Crimson, and we produced over 100,000 barrels year-to-date up there in that play.
As you may have seen in our prior operations release, we did had a good test on our Covington-Upchurch well, although it was a limited test. We only perforated the toe of the well, meaning that we only really opened up a very small percentage of the entire horizontal leg that we drilled. That well or that zone produced an approximately 6.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, about 33% of that were liquids. We\'re completing that well in stages so that we could try to isolate any water encroachment that might possibly occur or might be encountered. And we should have more definitive results on that well in the near future, but we\'re very pleased with that well and look forward to giving you those results here in the very near term.
Our fourth quarter drilling activity has been slower than we were in the first part of the year. Our rig is coming back to us in early December up in Madison Grimes, where we\'ll kick off our 2013 program. Again, we have 18,500 net acres approximately up there in that area, with over 170 gross locations in the Woodbine, and over 300 locations in the Eagle Ford and the Georgetown.
So we\'re anxious to get back out there and start drilling again as soon as we get the rig back. Also during the quarter, we were able to successfully recomplete -- or successfully complete our sidetrack of the Catherine Henderson A-6 well that Joe had mentioned earlier. Again, that well was producing 7.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which included about 550 barrels of condensate and NGLs per day.
So that was very good for us to get that well back online and put it back on pretty much the same production rate it was prior to going down.
In terms of other activity, we\'re seeing increased activity around our acreage in South Texas, especially at the Buda and the Pearsall formations. We\'ve seen a number of wells drilled into the Buda, just offsetting our Dimmit County acreage position. We have about 4,300 net acres there, and then we have another 2,300 net acres up in Zavala County, where we\'ve drilled 2 Eagle Ford wells, but also it looks  that Pearsall is becoming more prospective in that area. So we\'ll continue to monitor that area. And hopefully, we can dedicate some capital there in 2013, as the results come in from some of these other wells that have been drilled in that area.
As I mentioned, we haven\'t finalized our budget for 2013. We\'re in the process of doing that now. But it is our intent to stay within cash flow and to the extent our results or the results around us warrant additional activity or additional capital, we will approach that based on the results of those activities.
So that\'s just a quick operations update. Again, we didn\'t have a lot of drilling activity in the quarter. But that\'s kind of an overview of what we did have.
So with that, we\'ll just open it up for questions and be glad to answer anything that you might have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]  We\'ll take our first question from Kim Pacanovsky from MLV & Co.
Kim M. Pacanovsky - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division
In your operational release at the very end of October, you had mentioned that there was not enough takeaway capacity in Iola Grimes for the Covington-Upchurch. Can you just give us an update on who is installing additional takeaway? What the timeline is? And is that the reason why you only completed the toe of the well, or was it just for the water isolation issues?
E. Joseph Grady
Well, to answer the first question, Kim, we expect to have our takeaway capacity in place by the first or early part of December, which will coincide with when we expect to have the completion of the well ready and -- or the completion done and be ready to produce. It is a temporary solution with longer-term possibilities in the works. But we will be able to produce starting around the 1st of December.

Kim M. Pacanovsky - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division
Okay. And so what is the temporary solution, what is the longer-term option?
E. Joseph Grady
Well, it\'s somewhat limited in capacity. We expect it\'ll be enough to take our production, but as the field grows, production from the field grows, it\'ll need to be able to accommodate more than what that temporary solution is capable of handling at this point.
Kim M. Pacanovsky - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division
Okay. And so -- and that\'s -- so there are negotiations ongoing with a third-party provider? Or is it premature until you get the full rate out of that well?
E. Joseph Grady
There are negotiations ongoing for the permanent solution as well.
Kim M. Pacanovsky - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division
Okay, super. Okay. And then just one more question on the Catherine Henderson. How long did that well produce before production was lost? And what were the original reserves? And what do you think you have remaining?
E. Joseph Grady
It came on in midyear, I think, in \'08, and has been our largest producer in that field since \'08. And then it went down in January. It sanded up, and we went in, which is not uncommon for this area. We went in to attempt to clean it out, the casing failed. And we tried a number of less costly exercises to try to restore and we ultimately ended having to sidetrack the well. And so now it\'s back at -- it\'s just a tad less than what it was when it went down, but it\'s also on a smaller choke. So...
Kim M. Pacanovsky - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division
And remaining reserves, any...
Thomas H. Atkins
No impact.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we\'ll take our next question from Will Green from Stephens.
Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Could you guys talk about maybe where well costs have been trending in the Woodbine? I know there\'s been a lot of increased activity, but kind of how are you thinking about kind of an average well or where you\'re hoping average well is going to be and what you kind of get through science and that sort of thing?
E. Joseph Grady
Yes. Our last well, which is this Covington-Upchurch well, is probably going to come in the 7 -- 4 to 7.5 range. We ultimately hope that we\'ll be able to do better than that. But that\'s kind of where we are at this point.
Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Great. And then, you guys don\'t have really a whole lot of -- held by [ph] production issues, meaning you guys don\'t have to run a rig here and there to hold leases. When you think about your CapEx budget next year, if you had kind of a theoretical $100 million or I guess $100 million is the easiest way to think about it, but how would you split the pie? Whatever the CapEx budget is, what percent goes to the Woodbine versus Eagle Ford? How -- what\'s your incremental dollar go to, and how do you split that up?
E. Joseph Grady
So we -- as Allan mentioned, we\'re currently working on our budget for this year. I suspect it won\'t be at that level. But whatever our CapEx budget ends up being for 2013, it\'sgoing to be focused primarily on the Woodbine or I would say the Madison and Grimes area, which would be -- could be a combination of Woodbine, Eagle Ford and/or Georgetown. But focus will be primarily the Woodbine.
Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division
You would say that the Madison and Grimes area is by far and away still the best use of your dollar right now?
E. Joseph Grady
Yes, I mean, it\'s the best use of our dollar. Our other areas, we\'re still excited about. But when you\'re trying to stay within cash flow, the Woodbine certainly rises to the top of the heap. And as you mentioned in the first part of your question, we don\'t face any huge expiration issues in any of our areas. So we do have the luxury of being able to zero in on those higher return areas. And as you know, the Woodbine is an evolving area that\'s getting a lot of attention these days. So to the extent we can continue to expand that, both within the Woodbine and the other areas that we believe produces to do that.

Operator
We\'ll take our next question from Curtis Trimble from Global Hunter Securities.
Curtis Ryan Trimble - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division
Just looking at the Covington-Upchurch again, can you talk a little bit about maybe lessons learned on that one? Do you expect some water issues on it or is it simply once bitten, twice shy with respect to experiences at the Canyon Ranch area?
E. Joseph Grady
Yes, Curtis, I think Tommy will give us a bit of color on that.
Thomas H. Atkins
Yes, I mean, what we noticed out here is that there are some zones or lessons that we really learned in the Covington-Upchurch is that there are, like I said, there are some low circulation zones out in here, whether they deal with some sort of natural fracture or whatever, we just want to treat those with kid gloves, so to speak. That\'s why we perforated just a zone down in the Covington-Upchurch at the toe, and it ended up being highly productive as a gas condensate zone. Really, we\'re taking that from the VIC well. We know that we\'ve drilled in the Woodbine section over in the VIC that has pay. However, we kind of got swamped with some water, extraneous water coming from another zone that we feel pretty confident about. And we didn\'t really, kind of, treat that well properly. That was really the lesson learned that we applied down at the Covington. And so going forward, knowing that this is -- there\'s been a lot of carbonate production out here, open hole completions, which are relying on fractures, I think what we\'ve kind of said is that we\'re going to treat each well just a little bit differently and kind of let the wellbore dictate how we complete these things. Still, the model is that there is vertical production in the Woodbine all throughout our area, and so we feel pretty confident about that.
Curtis Ryan Trimble - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division
Good. Then if I could hit the follow-up, just talk about liquidity positioning, 2013 borrowing base, redeterminations, possibly new sources of liquidity, joint ventures, anything like that as we look forward a few quarters?
E. Joseph Grady
Well, starting with the easy one, which is redetermination, we just completed that. Our borrowing base was reaffirmed to $100 million. And so our next redetermination is May 1 in 2013. As far as other possibilities, that is something that we certainly think would be -- or being able to increase our CapEx budget in 2013 is something that will be beneficial to all of our shareholders. And so we\'re constantly looking at possibilities in which to be able to increase that capital availability. But certainly, in terms that would be good for the whole shareholder base.
Operator
And we\'ll next take our question from Eric Anderson from Hartford Financial.
Eric B. Anderson - Hartford Financial Management, Inc.
I wonder if I could follow a little bit up on questioning on the Covington-Upchurch. Having perforated the toe of the horizontal portion of the well, is there anything that we could take away from that in terms of its production from that one zone, relative to the other zones that are there, I don\'t know if it\'s a 15- or 20-stage horizontal you\'ve got there?
Thomas H. Atkins
Well, I mean, we\'d love to be able to multiply 15 stages times 6 million, 7 million a day equivalent. I don\'t think that\'s the way it works. So we think that it\'s going to be a very good well, and we\'re very, very excited about it. And we\'re in the process of completing it right now, and you really don\'t know until you put this thing, drill out all the plugs and put it on and let it kind of find itself after a couple of weeks. But again, I think that we\'re very, very encouraged by what we\'re seeing from the wellbore at this point.
Eric B. Anderson - Hartford Financial Management, Inc.

Now is that fairly close to another well in that same block of acreage that you have in that area?
Thomas H. Atkins
We\'ve only drilled 2 wells down in Grimes County, one is the Yates, which is probably about, I guess, 4 miles, 3 miles to the west of the Covington-Upchurch, it\'s in kind of a little different part of the Woodbine section, in that it\'s black oil. And here, we\'ve got a gas/condensate type of reservoir. And we knew that kind of going in, this -- again, the model is that we\'re kind of sticking around where vertical production has been.
Eric B. Anderson - Hartford Financial Management, Inc.
Okay. And if I could just follow-up in terms of when you go to allocate capital next year, Joe, for the drilling program, how are you guys thinking about where you\'re going to concentrate on drilling on the Madison, Grimes County? Are you going to stick to the area that has performed the best in terms of those 1000, 1300-barrel a day IPs or how are you going to sort of proceed?
E. Joseph Grady
I would say our primary focus would be in that area. But I don\'t want anybody to think that we\'re still not excited about the other 2, because we are. We\'ll certainly watch the Covington-Upchurch well and see how it performs. And so we could end up doing more down there based on results from that. We still -- at some point, we\'ll go back to the area, Chalktown area, we call it, where the VIC well is. But I would say at least as of right now, prior to finalizing our budget, that we\'d be focused primarily, on what we call our Force area, which is where those, the Mosley and the Pain and Grace Hall wells are.
Eric B. Anderson - Hartford Financial Management, Inc.
And where you kick off the whole program?
E. Joseph Grady
Yes.
Operator
Take our next question from Michael Glick from Johnson Rice.
Michael A. Glick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
Just another question on the Covington-Upchurch. I mean, do you expect the remainder of the lateral to be kind of a gas condensate well? Or is the reason that it was so gassy because you drilled into a natural fracture?
Thomas H. Atkins
No. We expect it to be a gas condensate well, probably representative of what the wellbore is. There\'s still -- it\'s still very, very rich gas. So that\'s part of that midstream solution. It\'s being able to attract all the value out of this wet stream.
Michael A. Glick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. And then when you\'re drilling these wells, are you drilling pilot holes and logging them and then deciding the appropriate Woodbine section to target?
Thomas H. Atkins
No, we\'ve got -- there\'s -- again, the whole model is there\'s vertical production immediately adjacent to all this stuff. There\'s ample well control to guide us where we want to be, and we\'ve been very, very diligent on being able to stay in zones and stuff like that. So we\'ve not had any issues with that. There\'s plenty of logs already out there. We would rather just move those dollars right into the well and completion part of it and try to drive those costs down.
Michael A. Glick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. And then shifting to production, just kind of where is your oils base decline rate and when you guys think you\'ll get back into production growth mode, is that kind of a second quarter of next year-type event?
E. Joseph Grady
Well, we, again, Michael, haven\'t finalized our budget for \'13. And the real answer to that will be a function of how much we end up spending next year. And as you know, we typically don\'t give guidance out much beyond the upcoming quarter. So I don\'t really have an answer to that. But certainly, it\'s something that we want to try to accomplish in 2013. And our CapEx program ultimately will be designed to do that. And once we finalize that budget, we\'ll share it with everybody. And that\'s why we\'re drilling the Force area. The Force area being the primary part of our CapEx budget at this point because those are very high-rate oil wells.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] And at this time, Mr. Grady, there are no further questions.
Allan D. Keel
Okay, Robin, thank you. And thanks to everybody for joining us this morning. And look forward to getting together again in the next quarter.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We do appreciate your participation.
