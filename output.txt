Brian Hill
Thank you, Catherine. And thank you everyone for joining us today. I\'d like to start by wishing you a Happy New Year and thank our team for their hard work over the holiday and their contributions to an extraordinary season. We delivered another exceptional quarter in Q3 with revenue growth continuing to reflect strength across all geographies and all channels.
The growing affinity for our brand, the particular excitement in the United States coupled with a fall winter season of beautiful high-quality products, and an aspirational omni-channel shopping experience fueled a 12.9% increase in comparable sales, marking our 17th consecutive quarter of comparable growth. This results in a three-year stacked comparable sales growth of 34.3% for the third quarter. Taking a deeper look, we delivered 18.8% top-line revenue growth. We\'re really pleased that this top-line revenue growth continues to flow through to the bottom line resulting in17.4% adjusted net income growth.
In the US, our brand affinity continues to grow. Our United States business saw incredible performance with a sustained revenue increase of 40%. This was driven by accelerated comparable growth in both our boutiques and online, as well as our new and expanded boutiques and marketing efforts designed to drive brand awareness. In Canada, in addition to strong same-store sales growth, we expanded our premier real estate portfolio opening boutiques in Quebec City and Toronto Premium Outlets, our first ever true Aritzia outlet.

TPO has been incredibly profitable, since its opening only two months ago TPO is paid back the original capital investors. To be clear, this is not the start of an outlet rollout. That being said, selectively leveraging outlets to move discontinued merchandise is something we\'ll continue to explore going forward. Our e-commerce business continues to grow in line with our expectations both in the US and Canada. We have met made many exciting investments to our line experience as Jennifer will discuss these initiatives shortly.
Our brand also continues to strengthen both in Canada and United States. French Vogue recently stated Aritzia has become the label of the moment this season. I\'m excited by the level support we have from key fashion influencers in the industry. Over the last quarter, we have seen celebrity influencers like Hailey-Bieber, Gigi and Bella Hadid, Kaia Gerber and a number of others voluntarily representing our product. Meghan Markle, who is an ongoing fan, recently wore our Wilfred Cocoon coat an extremely important public appearance. In addition, Kendall Jenner who has 100 million Instagram followers launched our extraordinarily successful super pup campaign.
Our influences will continue to be part of our marketing strategy as we move forward. We attribute our 34 years of success to a first-rate business model; well define growth strategies and ongoing investments in infrastructure. We will continue to focus on what has worked for us.
I will now turn the call over to Jennifer to further discuss these investments and then I will update you on our strategic growth initiatives.
Jennifer Wong
Thank you, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by providing an update on the exceptional performance of our new Vancouver distribution center since it commenced operations. I will then discuss some of the infrastructure investments that in addition to maximizing our current business also enable our long-term growth. We have now successfully managed our first season in the new 225,000 square foot distribution center following the seamless transition last September. We are extremely pleased with the functionality of the new facility and the performance of our team who delivered superior results through this peak selling period.
During Black Friday, the new DC meaningfully increased throughput compared to the previous year in the previous facility. The new DC was designed to scale both in terms of form and function. So in addition to this immediate benefit, this new distribution center should accommodate our West Coast growth over the next 8 to 10 years.
Turning to digital. We continued our investments in search engine and core site optimization which contributed to the e-commerce growth during the quarter. In the Q1 update, I spoke about the five key strategies that would support our e-commerce growth and will now update on each. The first strategy is to increase digital marketing to drive customer acquisition and retention. Our digital marketing programs include search engine optimization enhancements, refinement of our email marketing and further leveraging our social media.
We made numerous technical enhancements to improve our search engine optimization results including navigation breadcrumbs, improve product descriptions and data-driven category naming. We are pleased with the positive impact this has had on new clients business. Second, we are focused on core site optimization which is about improving the digital experience to ensure that aritzia.com continues to elevate our aspirational client experience. In late October, the team delivered user reviews which allow our client to better understand fit and quality while she shopped digitally. We are excited about the client feedback and in fact the product teams are using the data to further improve the fit and quality of our product.

This feature is boosting our conversion rate especially in the US where there are currently fewer boutiques to try on items in person. Third, with regards to growing our client telling programs, we are in the early phases of leveraging data and analytics to advance our understanding of our clients and their behavior. This will enable us to predict their needs and further exceed their expectations. We have selected the software and service providers for our analytics foundation. The implementation is now underway, scheduled to be completed in the second half of fiscal 2020. This work will allow us to leverage the customer data collected by our new point-of-sale system.
Fourth, we continue to develop our omni-channel fulfillment capability. Again, our new point-of-sale system is the foundation for a multi-year strategy that is intended to align our people, processes and systems so our clients can shop and receive our products through any of our Channel. We are working through options to launch store inventory visibility followed by additional system and options including buy -online, pick -up in store and store inventory fulfillment. 
Finally, our fifth strategy is to enhance our international website and explore opportunities to expand our international online business. We continue to evaluate our international website and our ability to ship to international markets to establish the foundation for future expansion by increasing brand awareness, gathering intelligence and identifying international markets to expand our boutique network.
Going forward, we have additional development for improving our digital experience such as the cleaner interface, enhanced graphics, a mobile focused checkout and all of these combined with omni-channel enhancements will contribute to an improved client experience online. And with our recent investments in a best-in-class analytics platform, we will be in a strong position to enhance sales through business intelligence and analytics. Following the successful distribution center and point-of-sale projects, the next business transforming and foundational technology we are implementing is the Product Lifecycle Management system or PLM. The PLM system will manage all of the data and support the processes to bring our product to market.
This will enable us to focus on innovation, drive quality, reduce speed to market where appropriate and ultimately optimize costs in manufacturing. We have neared the end of the selection process and will begin design and implementation soon.
I will turn it back to Brian to speak to our future growth strategy.
Brian Hill
Thank you, Jennifer. As a reminder of growth strategies, we\'re invested in growing our e-commerce business, expanding our boutique network, driving exclusive brand and product innovation, building brand awareness and enhancing long-term profitability. Specifically, our e-commerce business is strong both in Canada and the United States, and we will continue to reap the benefits initiatives that Jennifer just shared. 
As mentioned on our last call, our growing brand awareness among clients and landlords continues to fuel new boutique opportunities for fiscal 2020, resulting in our most robust US boutique pipeline to date. We are seeing and benefiting from great leasing opportunities due to our exceptional performance, excitement around our brand and the favorite real estate environment.
Current negotiations would have us opening approximately six boutiques in the United States, four of which are in new markets. In Canada, our Bloor Street flagship will reopen in February double its previous size at almost 11,000 square feet, providing an aspirational shopping experience anchoring our largest market. 
Looking forward to 2020, we plan to expand reposition three to four additional boutiques in Canada. Our primary marketing objective to build brand awareness, remains a key component of our overall strategy as we see acceleration in our influencer program, we will continue to use both paid and organic influences, securing celebrity and digital influencer coverage, which will accelerate word-of-mouth and drive new client acquisition.

Core to our fundamental marketing strategy, we will also continue to focus on elevating the client experience through optimized content and creative initiatives that surprise and delight our clients. In addition, connected closely to the client work identified earlier in the call, we will continue to drive retention through clientele activations. Finally, long- term profitability continues to be a focus. We believe in driving top-line revenue with growth that is mirrored in our bottom line. Todd will speak to the financial highlights in more detail shortly.
In conclusion, we are excited by our growth and financial performance across boutiques and online, both in Canada and the US in Q3. We continue to drive strategic investments both in our e-commerce business and the expansion of our premier boutique network with a strong pipeline for fiscal 2020 including new markets that will grow our geographical base in the US. In addition, we will continue to incorporate influencers into a broader marketing strategy which will bring further affinity to our brand. 
As Jennifer mentioned, we\'re investing in best-in-class infrastructure and technology solutions that will enable advanced insights into our client telling program, and enhance our omni-channel capabilities. Investments such as these will see Aritzia continue to elevate our client experience.
We\'re looking forward to a successful fiscal 2020 starting with an exciting new spring season. With that, I will turn the call over to Todd to review our financial results in further detail.
Todd Ingledew
Thank you, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. To echo Brian, we are extremely pleased to have delivered an exceptional third quarter following our strong first half of the year. Net revenue for the third quarter grew 18.8% to $243 million from $204 million last year. The revenue increase was led by growth in our e-commerce business, as well as strong performance in our boutiques across both Canada and the US. 
We were particularly pleased with our US business which once again generated 40% revenue growth this quarter, driven by the strength of our new and existing boutiques, our focused on e-commerce investments and our marketing.
Comparable sales increased 12.9% accelerating from the 11.5% growth that we achieved in the second quarter. The comp rose was driven by the strong reception to our fall/winter product. In addition, we had a successful Black Friday event as the prominence of this period continues to grow in Canada. Net revenue also benefited from the addition of eight new boutiques and five expanded or repositioned boutiques since the end of the third quarter last year. Gross profit margin for the quarter was 43.1% as compared to 44.8% in the third quarter last year. The 170 basis point decreased in gross profit margin was due to a 110 basis point impact related to the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the remainder of the margin decrease was primarily driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by ongoing sourcing initiatives.
Our SG&A expenses as the percent of net revenue were flat to last year at 23.3%. Leverage on fixed costs was offset by our continued investments in people, technology and infrastructure. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 14.3% to $57.1 million or 23.5% of net revenue compared to $50 million or 24.4% of net revenue in the third quarter last year. Adjusted net income increased by 17.4% to $35.9 million or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $30.6 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the third quarter last year.
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was a $123 million, up from a $105.2 million at the end of the third quarter last year. The $18 million cash balance increase was after a $59.1 million payment to reduce our credit facility, as well as $9.4 million in share repurchases over the last 12 months. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $75 million compared to $134.1 million at the end of the third quarter last year. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was a $106.4 million, reflecting a 15.4% increase from the end of the third quarter last year.

During the quarter, we repurchase 304,000 shares through our NCIB. This brings our total repurchases to 550,000 shares since we implemented the NCIB in May for total cash consideration of $9.4 million. Subject to market conditions, we will continue repurchasing shares opportunistically.
Turning to our outlook. As previously stated, we have had an exceptional fall winter season, including the increasing prominence of Black Friday in Canada, which continues to pull revenue from the fourth quarter to the third quarter. We are expecting a healthy yet uneventful end of season sale period and comparable sales of mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. Due to the further weakening of the Canadian and continued pressure from higher raw material costs, we now expect gross profit margin to be moderately down for the fiscal year. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be consistent with fiscal 2018.
In conclusion, we are extremely pleased with our financial performance. We are well-positioned to drive consistent, sustainable revenue and earnings growth and to increase shareholder value as we remain on track to meet or exceed our stated fiscal 2020-2021 performance targets. 
With that we will now welcome questions. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session
[Operator Instructions]
The first question comes from Mark Petrie with CIBC. Please go ahead.
MarkPetrie
Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. US obviously remain a clear point of strength. You\'ve been very methodical in your growth there and I assume you\'re not going to deviate from that approach, but even considering that can you just walk us through your thinking in terms of opening six stores next year and is there something you could see to push that number higher?
BrianHill
Yes, thanks for that call or the question. We, once again we put a lot of irons in the fire and we wait to the opportunity is right, and the negotiations are such and marking conditions are such and vacancies are such in this shopping center and then sometimes things take time. Sometimes there are expansions and things like that. This is by far and away the most we\'ve opened in the United States at any point in time. So we\'re quite pleased with that, but we are still negotiating on some other deals and where we can confirm that\'s approximately how many we foresee opening at this point in time. That number could increase slightly as well and following year appears to be a healthy opening schedule as well.
So I mean we don\'t ever get ahead of ourselves here and we think six in the US is we digest those and continue to drive our e-commerce channel in the US as well. And growing that that we think our growth in the US right now at 40% in the last quarter and previous to that I believe we were closer up to 50%. We think that\'s a pretty healthy growth rate in the United States for now.
MarkPetrie
Yes and does the six include pop ups which I think you\'ve been using a little bit more? 
BrianHill
No. We are looking at other pop-ups as well that\'s six full line Aritzia stores all in extremely high AAA centers with extremely good locations and large footprints. So these are all meaningful store openings in key markets, four of them which we mentioned are in new markets and they will be our flagship stores in those markets for many years to come. So we\'re pretty excited about those.
MarkPetrie
Yes, okay. And then just again on the US, I mean obviously you highlighted the top-line revenue growth and you highlight an impact of sort of leveraging social media and obviously that\'s paying off in terms of building brand awareness. How do you think about that for the next year? I mean is there still just lots of runway in terms of leveraging what you\'re already doing or can you push into an additional initiatives like collaborations and that sort of thing?

BrianHill
We\'re looking at everything right now. We\'ve-- the promotions and marketing we\'ve done of late in the United States this year have been extremely successful. So we\'re not going to get away from those, and we\'re going to continue to look at opportunities to increase our marketing and increase our brand awareness in the United States. I think there are lots of opportunities, potential opportunities in front of us. And there\'s a lot of brand awareness and we can continue to increase. 
I think we\'ve really just got the tip of the iceberg. We\'re getting a lot of recognition from important people influencers and celebrities alike, but we have a long way to go yet and before the general public we become the same brand in the United States as we are in Canada here. So it\'s a lot of opportunity ahead of us and we\'re going to be exploring all of them and no doubt pursuing some of those.
MarkPetrie
Okay, thanks. Just a last one. I am wondering I guess Todd if you can just sort of elaborate on the comment about flat EBITDA margins for the year. They\'re up pretty significantly year-to-date and just if you could elaborate on the drivers behind that in Q4.
ToddIngledew
Absolutely. That will be driven by the expected pressure on our gross profit in Q4 and flat SG&A margin with pick up from other income and really related to our hedging program, where we\'ve seen benefits from realized gains on our forward contracts.
MarkPetrie
Okay and then so the pressure on gross margin that\'s just continuation of FX and then maybe more on the raw materials?
ToddIngledew
It\'s really from the further weakening of the Canadian dollar. We\'re going to see additional pressure there and then continued pressure from the raw material cost. And if I could add, those raw material costs really hit us in the second half of the year here in Q3 and Q4. And that\'s when it\'s hitting us. So they didn\'t really hit us in one and two as much as expected and our inventory is very clean right now. And so our markdowns are actually in really great shape. It\'s just that those other two factors are meaningful for us, FX and raw material cost.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird.
MarkAltschwager
Good afternoon, thanks and congrats on a great quarter. Just dovetailing, I guess on that, end of that the discussion on gross margin. Looking into Q4 in 2019 can you discuss some of the actions you\'re taking to mitigate some of the raw material pressures? And just given that some of the pressures seem to be intensifying especially on the FX front, curious if that changes your calculus at all regarding taking price increases.
ToddIngledew
Yes. So the initiatives that we\'re looking at as far as a gross profit pressure goes and mitigating would really be more applicable to FY20. We\'re, as you\'re stating, we continually review our pricing and opportunities within that and then we have our ongoing sourcing initiatives as well that will be offsetting some of the pressures we\'re seeing from the increases in raw materials. 
BrianHill
And we\'ve made some great headway on sourcing and sourcing opportunities, but price have down, price wool, some of these other commodities are increasing meaningfully. That said, one of the things going forward and a bit more of a mid to longer term view is as we continue to grow our United States business more and more and more the FX becomes less and less of a factor for us as well. So we\'re looking forward to the days when FX affects us to a much lesser degree.
MarkAltschwager
Thank you and then on the product side. The press release mentioned the elevated product offering driving growth. I know in recent quarters really transactions have been the primary driver to comp, and I\'m curious about signaling that maybe you\'re seeing a bit of a lift from an AUR perspective as well. Just any color there?

ToddIngledew
Yes. So the strong reception to our product continues to be the driver of our comp. And we\'re seeing strength as we said across all towns and all geographies, but we are seeing especially in this quarter the driving of higher average selling price given the success of our outerwear program. And we still saw a traffic though and transactions as the primary driver, but we did see again increases in average selling price due to the success of our outerwear program.
Operator
The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
LorraineHutchinson
Thank you, good afternoon. I wanted to just get a little bit more clarity on the dynamics into a quarter. It sounds like you pulled some sales into November out of December with a strong Black Friday, but your promotional cadence and merchandise margins seemed aligned with your plan. So can you just talk about how you did that? And then how that\'s affected the outlook for the fourth quarter same store sales?
BrianHill
So I\'ll take that. So what\'s happened here in Canada is that we\'ve started to mirror the United States selling period. And we adopted Black Friday and the corresponding sales around Black Friday sort of two, three years ago and it\'s just been gaining more and more momentum in the Canadian marketplace. So it\'s not necessarily something that we\'re initiating and we\'re doing. It\'s just something that\'s been happening in the marketplace, but we\'ve done an excellent job of though is capitalizing on that. And as the traffic and the purchasing is shifting to that period in late November.
We\'ve and our teams have just made -- are being very opportunistic in capitalizing on that. That affects early certainly December sales for sure. I mean we look at the week that we used to have which used to be a normal week and now it\'s anything but a normal week. It\'s one of the best shopping weeks of the year and revenue weeks of the year for Aritzia. So that money comes from someplace and we call it jokingly now the last two three years the early December hangover because as more and more money gets spent in the last week of November, we\'re seeing sort of our sales get checked so to speak in the first two weeks of December.
We don\'t see that in the United States because it\'s always been that way. And things haven\'t changed there but we\'re seeing the shift from early December into November. And so that affects the first few weeks of December and then we start playing catch up again as those things happen. But this is here to stay. It\'s not going to change at this point in time, and so we have to be prepared for it and just try and capitalize as best we can. And it\'s just the new reality. So we\'re not really looking at December today and early December sales as compared to four years ago, but we\'re looking at it is as what we think the whole balance is and overall. And we are extremely pleased overall with the holiday season which used to run in Canada for about a four-week period from December 10th to January 10th but now runs for a six or seven week period and depending on when Thanksgiving falls.
And so now we\'re looking at it as six or seven week period and based on looking at that we\'re extremely excited with the performance of our sales and stores and our people within that period.
Operator
The next question comes from Patricia Baker with Scotiabank.
PatriciaBaker
Thank you very much and I\'ll add my congratulations on a great quarter. Just want to follow up a little bit on Lorraine\'s question. So certainly understand the pulling the early holiday sales from Q4 into Q3 with adopting Black Friday in Canada, but I\'m just curious, it did not have any impact at all on your margins, pulling those sales forward, they would have been marginally more promotional?

BrianHill
I mean, Todd you want to take this or --
ToddIngledew
Yes. We, I think as we stated in the press release we had consistent markdowns quarter-over-quarter. So we didn\'t have additional pressure.
PatriciaBaker
Okay, that\'s interesting. And then just going back to the overall in Q3, can you talk about the categories that did extremely well for you and whether there was a difference in where the strength was in the U.S. versus Canada from a product perspective?
BrianHill
So, yes, I mean one of the things we\'ve always prided ourselves as being having a balanced assortment of clothing. And whether it be t-shirts, blouses, sweaters, coats, pants dresses, we\'ve always been extremely focused on being balanced there. We certainly see, we don\'t really see a difference in the United States and Canada and our products so to speak. Where we see the difference is more so east to west. So New York acts a little bit more like Toronto and Vancouver and Calgary act a little bit more like Seattle. And then when we get into sort of temperate climates like San Francisco and Los Angeles, we certainly see a difference in the product that sells for us.
But we had a great outerwear season and we\'ve had great sweater season and warm weather product. We\'ve had a great season with that and but that\'s not really different than anything else we\'ve had in the past. And so we see --we just see a balance and how we sell our product and we think that\'s important to sustain profitability and growth. It\'s just having a balanced approach to all the product we sell. Obviously, we have items that sell better than others and they evolve over time and that\'s natural, but we haven\'t seen anything out of the ordinary that we hadn\'t seen in the past.
Operator
The next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. 
CamiloLyon
Thanks and good afternoon. And I\'ll apologize in advance for my voice. You talked a lot about the success with your influencer campaign driving awareness in the US. I\'m curious to know, you said that you were going to continue and accelerate that in 2019, curious to know if that\'s going to be part of an incremental amount of marketing dollars or is there a shift of marketing dollars that you\'re planning to allocate to this particular bucket next year?
BrianHill
Hi, Camilo, Brian. Hopefully you\'ll get better soon. We actually think there will be some incremental marketing dollars there that will be spent. Some of it will be shifted over but some of it will for sure be incremental and depending on what we\'re successful in landing here as far as programs go will be incremental. However that said, we look at all the incremental dollars being spent on marketing and we look at it as having payback in the short term as well. So, obviously, there\'s long- term brand payback but there\'s also a short-term sales impacts.
And we expect to deliver any kind of incremental marketing dollars on short- term sales impact. So we shouldn\'t see a hit to our profits or anything by doing this quite the contrary I think that our objective is to see a short-term increase in profits by doing these marketing initiatives, incremental marketing initiatives plus the beneficial additional benefits are exposing our brand to more people and certainly propelling it. So we look at the marketing as both short-term sales and long-term brand propelling. And we expect any incremental dollars being spent to be paid back and then some on both those counts.
CamiloLyon
Sounds good, it certainly looks like it\'s working very well for you. Along those lines with respect to the new stores that you plan an opening in the US that use it for new markets, can you give us a little bit of insight into the online demand trends that you\'re seeing in those markets? And I\'m assuming that that\'s led you to go after those markets because you\'re seeing a robust amount of customer demand come from those regions, but I wanted to clarify that and just make sure that is indeed the case.

BrianHill
Yes. I mean we\'re we certainly look at that but that\'s not the only component we look at. Obviously, we look at shopping centers and a market could be quite a robust e-commerce market for us, but it might have five sort of equal centers or places locations we could open. Whereas another market might have be a robust market but might have one premier shopping destination or even have less of a robust market, but only have one premier shopping destination. So that may be targeted prior to the area that we have a larger e-commerce platform. And yet it\'s just not obvious as to which it would be the store that we\'d open. We\'d have to open several to capitalize on that.
So we look at e-commerce as one of the data points. We look at the shopping center and or street performance. We look at the weather. We look at operational synergies and so. And then there\'s just timing, timing of opportunities to open up these stores. I mean our business in the United States is so good right now that we feel that we can open up in any premier shopping destination in United States right now and do extremely well. And we\'re getting, we\'re seeing lots of deals and opportunities in these markets and in these locations. So, certainly, we take into these data points but at the end of the day right now the way things are going everything we\'re opening is profitable right now.
So we\'re continuing just to explore wherever we can and just pick the ones we think are going to be the most profitable.
CamiloLyon
Great. And then just my final question, you have the benefit of offering a very broad assortment of apparel to your customers. I\'m wondering if you\'re seeing any differences in growth rates between your denim lines that you increasingly launched as well as relative to your athletic line, the constant? And if that\'s telling you anything about where fashion trends may be headed?
BrianHill
Yes. I mean there\'s a lot of different fashion trends out there, and there\'s some of them are male-dominated and some are female dominated for sure as well. The interesting thing about the denim, it was so successful that we sold out and although we received a second fairly large batch just before the holidays, it sold out as well. So we\'re not really in a position right now to see the denim affect our bottom line. We have some big shipments and starting to properly stock our denim now for our new denim initiatives now in the early part of this year. And we\'ll start hopefully seeing some more meaningful drop down to our bottom line in the first quarter.
However, we still seem to have a customer for our athletic clothing, and that\'s doing really well. But we sell fashion; we sell athletic; we sell denim. We\'re selling functional clothing and some outerwear and things like that. And we\'re still doing extremely well with dresses and younger fashion. So we, as you mentioned, we have a broad customer and we just seem to be, we don\'t focus on any one particular item and/ or particular category. And by doing so I think that\'s what allows us to continue to grow consistently quarter after quarter.
Operator
The next question comes from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets. 
IreneNattel
Thanks and again great quarter. You certainly mentioned you called out outerwear, you mentioned denim, wondering about leather and also wondering about you categorize the quarters exceptional. Were there any key learnings or takeaways from that that you are factoring into your spring/summer?
BrianHill
I mean we had exceptional not just on the product and sales, but we had an exceptional quarter as far as our infrastructure and improvements and things like that when as well. So I can let Jennifer talk about that, but because we\'re only going to build on those. I mean as you know, Irene, we have core product in our stores and we continue to carry that product over from season to season to season. So we\'re consistently doing well with that product. And so much as the leather goes; we\'re continuing to expand that opportunity. We had some meaningful --, we had a extremely expensive leather jacket came in and it was sold out before it even arrived online and sold all through all our units. 

And granted we didn\'t buy a lot but it was shocking to us the price point it was four digits. We hadn\'t sold anything at that price point previous, and we sold out of it before it even hit our floor. So we\'re continuing to explore all sorts of opportunities and quite frankly that one actually left us probably a little bit more confused and insight that we did so well with a product that at that price point. So we\'re continuing to build on all our successes as best we can. And our whole idea is testing things so that we can carry them through and build on them for the following season.
So we\'re not just carrying over and looking at successes from fall, winter into spring, but we look at successes from the previous year into spring, summer and try to build on those as well. So we\'re looking forward to an exciting spring launch and an exciting spring/summer season coming up.

Thank you, good afternoon. I was just looking to the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about or give me a little more color around where your new stores are going to be opened, where are the new four versus the new or versus the two existing markets? 
BrianHill
The two existing markets are in and around Manhattan where we continue to excel in our sales. And it\'s a very, very extremely large market as you know. And then the other ones we are just --we actually had to draw the map and figure out where our next stores would be. We\'re just going down the coast, the Eastern seaboard and slowly working our way down the Eastern seaboard. And continuing down the West and the Midwest. We\'re not opening at this point in time in Ala Moana mall in Hawaii and unfortunately for most of our team in Vancouver who would be delighted to go look over see that store or check in on it on a weekly basis.
And at this point in time presently we don\'t have anything definitive in Los Angeles and expansions in there. We\'re working on some deals there, but we probably see those coming in the following year. So we\'re still not going headlong into too much warm weather, but we\'re continuing to expand some in warm, some more warmer weather market. So it\'s a mix of essentially what we\'re doing and continuing to grow within the markets and new markets that are close by from there.
StephenMcLeod
Okay, that\'s great. 
BrianHill
Sorry I would elaborate more but I just don\'t know if every single one of our lease is finalized at this point in time. So I don\'t want to share specifics with you at this point in time. I\'m not trying to be coy here. I just want to make sure that I don\'t have the real estate department coming in after this call and marching into my office and getting in trouble here.
StephenMcLeod
Yes, of course, okay, thanks Brian. And then I guess when maybe without giving away too much detail like is the time-- you are able to give a little color around the timing of store openings through 2020?
BrianHill
I\'m not sure specifically when they are, Todd\'s flipping around, he knows a little bit more when they are. Typically we try to open them in spring and then we try to open them in for fall. And we try not to open a lot in between, but and then we have a schedule. We have certain capabilities. So when we look at opening a new store, we\'re looking at repositioning. Repositioning are just as much incremental initiative as a new store is because essentially we\'re building a brand new store in that case and doing new leases and everything else too.
So we kind of internally, although externally we look at them as differently because one\'s incremental sales much more incremental sales and than a repositioning. They still are the same amount of logistics on our part. So we kind of fill up our dance card accordingly. But, Todd, do you have anything you want to share there?

ToddIngledew
Well, I think that along with the outlook for next year will provide the cadence of the stores on the next call.
StephenMcLeod
Okay, that\'s helpful. And then I just want to follow up on one of the other questions just regarding you have some pretty positive commentary around the spring, once you get through the weaker or not weaker, but relatively slower Q4 given the strength in Q3, is there anything in particular that you are launching in the spring that you expect to be a particularly material comp driver? Or is it just the overall collection and a broader mix of what you have coming to market?
BrianHill
I think it\'s the overall collection and a broader mix. It\'s a bit of a double-edged sword though because we had such a fantastic spring summer last year that we should be able to build upon that. On the other hand comping on a fabulous spring/summer last year becomes more challenging too. So it\'s a bit of a double-edged sword, but we\'re just excited. Our product just seems fabulous right now. Our customers are responding extremely well to it. And every time a new season comes in and fresh looking merchandise, everybody seems to get excited both internally and externally.
So we\'re just always excited at this time of year to start looking in and introducing new product to our customers.
StephenMcLeod
Okay. That\'s great. And then just finally, Jennifer, you mentioned the PLM system being your sort of next major infrastructure milestone, can you just give a little bit of color around how that new system is different than how you currently manage your product life cycles?
JenniferWong
Yes, right now our systems are, we use SAT and a lot of things are spreadsheet base and our team follow a very rigorous development process that has been refined over the years and honed over the years. And the system won\'t replace anything other than it will automate a lot of activities that are currently manual. And then this will allow our teams and the people to do less busy work and more actual innovative work and more value-added work. And so just in terms of our scalability, it\'s a system that we believe is necessary to enable our growth and to scale further. And allow us to keep our product cost in line, as well as our timelines in line.

The next question comes from Meaghen Annett with TD Securities.
MeaghenAnnett
Thank you, good afternoon. Given the strong position of the balance sheet, can you just talk to your priorities for uses of cash, looking at opportunities for organic growth in particular? I know you touched on this a bit, but does there come a point where you decide it\'s time to really put your foot on the gas to make a stronger push into the U.S. market like what you need to see happening there to really decide to go ahead and accelerate your growth plans?
BrianHill
Yes. I don\'t think that having the cash is really inspiration for us to continue to speed up the entry into the United States more so than we are into new markets in the United States. I think we have a plan. We\'re going to stick to the plan. We are extremely profitable. I will say that we are looking at the cash. I don\'t think we\'ve ever had this much cash on the balance sheet. So it\'s somewhat new to us. And we\'re certainly going to be looking at certain opportunities, but there are all sorts of other opportunities we\'re going to reanalyze as well annually in our strategic planning. 
So we are going to continue to look at those and but at some point in time, yes, we are going to start finding reasons to invest this cash and how we invest that at this point in time it\'s unclear, but right now we are not making expansion decisions as of right now based on having excess cash on the balance sheet.
MeaghenAnnett
Can you just give any thoughts around completely the current NCIB? 

ToddIngledew
Yes, we will, as we have been for the last three quarters will continue to purchase opportunistically as market conditions dictate. And I think as Brian has said, we are looking out into next year at our strategic use of cash and would provide a further update once we make those decisions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair.
DylanCarden
Yes, thank you very much. I was hoping maybe to get an update on specifically the direct channel. If you kind of go back a year or so that was really expected sort of start seeing some deceleration as well as the growth rate is concerned right about now, but it seems like there is just a lot going on particularly from a marketing standpoint. And I don\'t know if there is any commentary made about what you are seeing in markets where you are opening a new store?
Just how that\'s sort of interacts with that channel? So suggest that maybe we are seeing a more stable or even acceleration in direct, and then sort of where that lands you potentially over the 2021, quarter of the business being in that channel target? Anything, I know I can\'t get hard numbers, but any sort of comments would be appreciated.
ToddIngledew
Well, as we said our e-commerce business accelerated this quarter and we do continue to see accelerated strength in markets, we\'re in new markets where we open stores. So those markets do see outpace growth compared to say the rest of the United States or even Canada, if we\'re opening in a new market in Canada. So there is a strong correlation there, but those again we are very pleased with the growth in our e-commerce business and expect that dynamic to continue.
DylanCarden
Sorry, the dynamic being sort of accelerated growth into next year, is that a fair takeaway.
ToddIngledew
Just strength in the business, strength in that channel of our business.
DylanCarden
In line with the target for a quarter of the business by 2021, there is no change to that kind of --
ToddIngledew
Correct.
DylanCarden
Thank you very much.
ToddIngledew
Really the only thing that\'s changed is our same store sales at retail have been growing faster than we had originally predicted. So that the e-commerce team is trying to doing their best and doing a great job of having a scramble and because the number, the 25% on keeps on changing on a little bit. So we\'re still targeted that. We\'re still confident we\'re going to get there, and but the number has changed and we are upping the ante as our same store sales continue to grow.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Petrie from CIBC.
MarkPetrie
Yes. Hi, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments and actually relate it back to some previous calls comments in terms of the performance of Chicago, maybe open the Chicago flagship maybe sort of opening opportunities in terms of attacking a luxury customer. Your comments around the leather jacket launch. And then, Todd, I think you touched on that average selling price was up, maybe that was more just mix, but I guess my question is do you think there\'s potentially an opportunity to be shifting the assortment up, upscale and as a result sort of seeing higher price points consistently in the store.
BrianHill
We get requests for more elevated product and we also get requests for more inexpensive product. There isn\'t a month goes by that I don\'t for some customer doesn\'t reach out to me to directly and complain that Aritzia prices are too high. And that\'s been consistent for the last 34 years. That said, we\'ve had great success in some of our higher-end products. Whether they be individual items or they actually be our Le Fou and 1-01 lines which are consistently sell out for us and are at a very high price point.
So we don\'t necessarily, we don\'t see us continuing specifically shifting our whole product mix. We just see as broadening our product and consistently broadening our product mix. So we do offer some higher end elevated fabrics and items and at the same time we want to make sure we\'re approachable and attainable to our younger customer as well. We don\'t want to alienate them. 

So we have a bit of both of those. We\'re opening in Hudson Yards in Manhattan pretty soon. And that will be a higher end customer for sure. We\'re surrounded by a lot of high-end customers within our high-end retailers within that new complex. And we\'ll see what happens with that there, but certainly our Rush Street store gave us a confidence to open in this shopping center.
And so as we continue to look at stores, there are certain locations that we feel that we will be successful in. And then it\'s also, it\'s within those locations where we are positioning ourselves also. Our Rush Street gave us confidence that we can be in amongst some of those luxury players and perform extremely well. So we\'re looking, we look at all locations, but typically at the end of the day if you\'re at the 50-yard line, you\'ll end up being successful. And it will always be a good location.
So whether that be in a high-end mall or a more higher volume mall or what-have-you just as long as you got a great location you\'ll be successful provided you do your --you\'re doing all your work properly.

Jeff Mezger
Thank you Jill. Good afternoon and Happy New Year to all of you. We produced solid results in 2018, as we continued to increase our scale, expanding total revenues to over $4.5 billion. We also significantly improved our profitability. We grew our operating margin by 120 basis points to 8.3% within our returns-focused growth plan’s 2019 target range, and expanded our gross margin to just above 18%, excluding inventory related charges for each metric.
As a result, we increased our pre-tax income by 27% to nearly $370 million, and excluding the accounting charges related to the federal tax legislation, we delivered return on equity of 14.4%, a 440 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. 
As we review our results relative to the guidance we provided prior to the start of our 2018 fiscal year, we finished the year stronger across most of our key financial metrics, including both operating and gross margin, SG&A, ROIC, and ROE. Overall, this past year reflected solid execution on our three year, returns-focused growth plan and achieving or exceeding most of our targets under the plan by the end of year two.
Specific to the fourth quarter, our results were consistent with the update we provided on November 14, with some lift in operating and gross margins. During the quarter, we grew our earnings per share by 14% to $0.96 on revenues of $1.3 billion. With our increased profitability in 2018, along with more efficient utilization of our assets and monetization of our deferred tax assets, we generated significant cash from operations.

We continued our balanced approach to allocating capital, investing approximately $1.9 billion in land acquisition and development, retiring $300 million of our senior notes, and repurchasing $35 million of our common stock, representing 1.8 million shares in late November. And we still ended the year with a healthy cash balance of roughly $575 million and over $1 billion in total liquidity.
With respect to our share repurchases, we took an opportunistic approach to buying back our stock with our equity at that time trading roughly 20% below our book value of $24 per share. Overall, the strong cash flow our business produced drove a significant decrease in our net debt to capital ratio to 41.6%, solidly within our recently reduced target range of 35% to 45%.
From a macro perspective, the favorable factors supporting housing demand remain in place. The economy is expanding, consumer confidence is high, employment is strong, wages are growing, and household formation is increasing. Alongside these positive factors, the supply of existing homes remains low at 3.9 months nationally and below that level in many of our markets, and single family housing starts for 2018 will once again be well under the long-term annual average. Taken together, these dynamics give us reason to remain encouraged even as heightened affordability pressures, which we are working to address are contributing to the pause by consumers on purchasing homes.
Our net orders improved a little relative to the mid-quarter update we provided on November 14 ending the quarter down 12%. Our net orders were impacted by the timing of community openings with more than 60% of our openings occurring in November, a point in the year where we don\'t typically see strong sales activity accompany the grand opening. That said, we continue to see a solid level of interest in homeownership as traffic levels in our communities in the fourth quarter held steady year-over-year. We\'re seeing buyers taking their time with the process, making multiple visits before committing to a purchase.
On a per community basis, our net orders were 2.9 per month in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2018 our average absorption pace increased to 4.1 per month as compared to 3.9 per month in the prior year.
Our net order value for the fourth quarter of $738 million was influenced by both a mix shift away from the West Coast and within this region a geographic shift to the lower priced inland markets. As a result, while our earning backlog was down 7% in units, our backlog value of $1.4 billion was down 14% year-over-year.
Heading into the new fiscal year, traffic levels in our communities remain steady. However our net orders were off to a slower start in the month of December, down 97 units or 15% year-over-year. December is typically our slowest selling month, and this year it is also one of our most difficult comparisons given the unseasonably strong net order activity we generated in the prior-year period. In light of this continued market uncertainty, we are only providing guidance for the first quarter of 2019 today, which Jeff will address in a moment.
As to community count with a sequential increase in our ending count in the fourth quarter, we reached a turning point in our average count, which was up slightly year-over-year. This, together with our planned openings in the first half of 2019, have us well positioned as the spring selling season begins. We continue to expect between 10% and 15% growth in our average community count for the full year.
In an effort to address affordability pressures, we\'ve taken proactive steps to reposition our product offerings in many of our open communities as well as our 2019 grand openings. The flexibility of our business model is an advantage as it allows us to move with demand at a fairly rapid pace in order to have the most compelling products in place for the spring. We are adding smaller square footage plans selected from our existing plan series in most of our communities and repositioning numerous model parts to demonstrate these more affordable homes.

In addition, we are also lowering the specification levels for our standard features within many of our communities. These spec-level changes don\'t necessarily require modifications in the models. Instead, we can utilize our design studios to showcase both standard and optional items. Our repositioning efforts expand the choices available to buyers in moving across the square footage band, and in selecting options in our design studios that they value most and can afford. Although we expect these shifts to moderate our ASP, we believe that we are making the appropriate adjustments to respond to home buyers needs and preferences.
Moving on to the market updates. In the West Coast region, where our net orders were down 21%. The inland areas held up relatively well as we’ve produced favorable net order comparisons in both the Inland Empire and Central California. However their growth was more than offset by a net order decline in the Bay Area, which accounted for the majority of our company\'s fourth quarter decrease in net orders.
We continue to experience delays in getting new communities opened in the Bay Area and as a result this division was impacted by a significant reduction in average community count of more than 40% year-over-year, down to only eight active communities at the end of the fourth quarter. In addition, with the Bay Area having sold through most of its higher ASP communities, in the range of $1.3 million to $1.8 million earlier in the year, we experienced a decline in the Bay Area net order ASP to $800,000 from $931,000 in the year ago period.
While this business is well positioned for today\'s market environment, the combined effect of having fewer open communities and lower ASPs in those communities impacted our net order comparisons for the West Coast region. It is worth noting that we saw year-over-year price appreciation in the Bay area communities that were started in the fourth quarter of both years, an indication that there continues to be strong demand at the lower price.
Looking ahead to the first half of 2019, we are anticipating a sizable increase in grand openings in the Bay area significant enhancing its community count by the second quarter of this year relative to year-end 2018. In our Southwest region, Las Vegas continues to be a solid market for us, with an absorption pays per community in the fourth quarter of just under five per month, the highest rate companywide.
In 2018, this division grew into our largest in terms of annual deliveries, and it is an increasingly important contributor to our overall results given its profitability. Inspirada our master plan in Henderson, we\'re selling five different product lines, which combined generated nearly 500 deliveries last year.
This community is also the side of our KB Project concept home, which we unveiled this week in conjunction with the Consumer Electronics Show. The full scale concept home has already received significant media attention for its innovation in showcasing how smart and sustainable technology can be used to offer convenient and wellness features to homebuyers. And while the Project Home is future oriented, we are planning to offer certain wellness features from this home as options in select communities in California later this year.
In Phoenix, while we were impacted by a sizable decrease in community count in the fourth quarter, demand was solid, driving an increase in absorption pace. With close to 10% of our company\'s grand openings this year planned for Phoenix, we\'re looking forward to expanding our business in this market, one that has experienced healthy population and job growth.
In our Central region, our net order shortfall was primarily driven by our Colorado division, which was impacted by the timing of new openings during the fourth quarter and by a decline in community count. However, we expect to see meaningful growth in community count in this division by the end of 2019.

Colorado is a market that has experienced significant price appreciation, with a median new home price of roughly $480,000 and a median retail price of $415,000. Our product offerings in this market are well positioned given our ASP of about $470,000 below median new home prices and at a reasonable premium to an older less efficient resale home. We expect our ASP in Colorado to move down in 2019, as we open new communities at lower price points reflecting our product shifts.
Wrapping up the market updates. Net order value grew 20% in the Southeast region and a 10% expansion and net orders, with every division producing a positive net order comparison, a solid end to a year of improving performance in this region. We look forward to continuing to increase our scale and profitability in the Southeast.
In closing, we believe we are well positioned for 2019. The impact of our returns focused growth plan is now clear, as we have significantly expanded the scale and profitability of our company, while strengthening our balance sheet. We have a growing community count, featuring product that is positioned to maximize affordability for the consumer and we have a talented team of employees that continues to execute our plan. In addition, with the recent decline in mortgage rates, we remain optimistic for the spring and the year ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds.
With that, I\'ll now turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review. Jeff?
Jeff Kaminski
Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our solid 2018 performance as we generated improvement in virtually all of our key financial profitability metrics along with a meaningful strengthening of our balance sheet. I will now review highlights of our financial and operational performance for the 2018 fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide our outlook for the 2019 first quarter.
Given the current volatility and market conditions ahead of the critical springs telling season, we are not reaffirming or providing 2019 full year guidance at this time. In the fourth quarter, our housing revenues were down 4% from a year ago to $1.3 billion, reflecting a 1% increase in homes delivered and a 5% decline in the overall average selling price of those homes.
As we mentioned during our November conference call, our fourth quarter housing revenues reflected headwinds from the historic rains experienced in Texas and fewer than anticipated spec sales and deliveries in the quarter. However, despite these fourth quarter headwinds our full year housing revenues of $4.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, primarily due to a 4% increase in homes delivered. 
Looking to the 2019 first quarter, we expect to generate housing revenues in the range of $800 million to $860 million. In the fourth quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered declined 5% to approximately $395,000. This decrease was primarily due to a shift in geographic mix with a smaller proportion of deliveries coming from our higher priced West Coast region. For the 2019 first quarter, we\'re projecting our overall average selling price to be in the range of $375,000 to $385,000.
Homebuilding operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $121.9 million compared to $131.9 million for the year earlier quarter, including total inventory related charges of $9.1 million in the 2018 quarter and $7.1 million a year ago. Excluding inventory related charges from both periods, our operating margin was 9.7% for the current quarter and 9.9% for the year earlier quarter. For the 2019 first quarter, we anticipate our homebuilding operating income margin excluding the impact of any inventory related charges will be in the range of 3.4% to 4.4%.

Our 2018 fourth quarter housing gross profit margin was 18.1%, including the $9.1 million of inventory related charges. Excluding the impact from these charges, our gross margin for the quarter was 18.7% compared to 18.6% for the same quarter of the prior year. As a result of reducing our outstanding debt and growing our unit deliveries, we have steadily decreased the level of incurred interest per delivery over the past several years to just $13,000 -- $13,200 per unit delivered or 3% of housing revenues in 2018.
In turn the lower levels of prior period incurred interest combined with the widening spread between active inventory and total debt have reduced our amortization of previously capitalized interest generating improvement in our housing gross profit margin of 80 basis points for the 2018 fourth quarter. 
Assuming no inventory related charges, we are forecasting a housing gross profit margin for the 2019 first quarter in a range of 16.6% to 17.2%, reflecting the typical seasonal first quarter decrease in operating leverage from lower revenues, partially offset by lower amortization of capitalized interest.
This first quarter range also now reflects the anticipated impact from the implementation of ASC 606, which will result in the reclassification of certain expenses previously included in construction and land cost to selling, general and administrative expenses.
Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio of 9% for the fourth quarter was up 30 basis points from last year\'s record low fourth quarter result, reflecting increased marketing expenses to support new community openings that are driving our expected community count expansion in 2019. We expect our 2019 first quarter SG&A ratio to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.5%, reflecting the decrease in operating leverage from lower revenues, additional marketing expenses and the ASC 606 reclassification mentioned earlier.
Moving on to taxes, our income tax expense of $32 million for the fourth quarter was predominantly a non-cash expense due to our deferred tax assets and represented an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. We currently expect our effective tax rate for the 2019 first quarter to be approximately 27%.
Turning now to community count, our fourth quarter average of 232 was up slightly from 228 in the same quarter of 2017. We ended the year with 240 communities, up 7% from a year ago. Of the 240 communities 34 communities or 14% were previously classified as land held for future development, compared to 41% or 18% at the end of 2017.
On a year-over-year basis, we anticipate our 2019 first quarter average community count will be up in the range of 6% to 10%. For four year 2019, we continue to expect growth in our average community count in the range of 10% to 15%. During the fourth quarter to drive future community openings we invested $443 million in land, land development and fees, with $184 million or 42% of the total representing new land acquisitions.
We ended the year with $574 million of cash and total liquidity of just over $1 billion, including availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We generated $222 million of net operating cash flow in 2018 after investments of nearly $1.9 billion in land acquisitions and development. Our investments in 2018 improved our land pipeline to nearly 54,000 lots, driving expected community count growth in 2019, while we reduce our inactive inventory by nearly $140 million to $238 million at year-end or 7% of our total inventory.
In addition, we used internally generated cash to opportunistically repurchase $35 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and retire all $300 million of our 7.25% senior notes earlier in the year.
Our current year profitability and deleveraging activities resulted in a 500 basis point year-over-year improvement in our year-end debt to capital ratio to 49.7% the first time that we have been sub-50% since 2005. In addition, we ended the year with a net debt to capital ratio of 41.6%, representing a 380 basis point improvement and our lowest year-end net leverage ratio since 2007.

These metrics reflect the achievement of one of the key components of our returns focused growth plan using significant cash flow generated from core operations along with monetizing our deferred tax assets and inactive inventory to reduce debt and at the same time increase land investment to drive future growth. We plan to continue with this approach and are targeting a minimum of $200 million of debt reduction in connection with the 2019 maturities of our convertible notes, and 4.75% Senior Notes in the first half of the year.
Reflecting on 2018, we made significant progress in our returns focused growth plan objectives. For the full year, we increase our total revenues to over $4.5 billion and grew our housing revenues and deliveries by 4% with an average community count that was 4% lower than in 2017. We also expanded our operating income margin and significantly improved our credit metrics, reflecting both our increased profitability and our debt reduction using internally generated cash.
In addition, excluding the non-cash charge for the impact of the new Tax Act our return on invested capital expanded by 300 basis points to 10.4% and our return on equity improved by 440 basis points to 14.4%. In 2019, we plan to continue executing on our roadmap for returns focused growth as we navigate market conditions. Our long-term objectives remain the same with a focus on increasing our scale, improving our profitability, increasing returns and reducing our leverage.

At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes on line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. 
Alan Ratner
Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First question, I was hoping to dig in a little bit on some of the initiatives you\'re taking on the product offering to try to drive down the ASP there. I was curious if you might be able to quantify at all what impact that could have either on margins, on price, on sales pace. I mean, how impactful should we anticipate this being obviously just given the 1Q guidance, but is this something that\'s going to drastically change kind of the way the year and even beyond unfolds?
Jeff Mezger
Yes, Alan I wouldn\'t say it\'s going to drastically change anything that\'s -- to me that\'s too tough a word. What we\'re doing is reacting to some of the affordability pressures that are out there. The order of magnitude, I just -- I\'ll gave you a generic example, if we had a model park where the product out there was 1,800 to 2,400 feet, we’ll introduce a model in the 1,400, 1,500, 1,600 foot range, so . you\'re dropping your base sales price $10,000, $12,000. 
Depending on where it is in the system, it may have no impact at all on margin because it\'s an area where the lot cost is a smaller percentage than directs, you are just lowering your directs and in turn lowering your sales price. 
If it\'s an area where the lot cost is a much bigger percentage, it could have a minor influence on the margin, but we\'re not doing it in an effort to compress margins. We think it\'s a way to hold if not increase our sales pace, which should in turn help you on the capitalized interest side. So, there’s a lot of different levers that you pull in doing this, but we just see it as normal course in our business.
Alan Ratner
Got it, that\'s very helpful. Second question, I was hoping you could just comment a little bit on what you\'re seeing in the incentive environment. We’ve heard from one of your peers earlier that indicated they got a little bit more aggressive in their quarter and kind of alluded to the fact that they might continue to be aggressive if demand doesn\'t pick up in the spring. You guys are not a big spec builder, so on that front it’s not like you’ve got a lot of inventory you want to clear and you\'ve been very focused on rebuilding that margin, but how do you think about the push and pull on incentives and volume and margin at this point?

Jeff Mezger
As you know Alan, in our business model, we focus on the best value to the customer in the price. So we are not an incentive-heavy business. I think our incentives did tick up in the quarter 30 bps year-over-year, so not a material move at all. It doesn\'t mean that we may not have changed our pricing structure when we open the community to a more aggressive price band when we opened it, but we try to stay out of the incentive game and get people the best price per foot for the home and let them go build their own value in the studio.

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen East
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Jeff, maybe you can -- in your prepared remarks, you talked a lot about the community growth that you\'ve got coming along. I guess for me, this is always the toughest thing to forecast is will they get open or not? When you sit here and look at your risks on getting these communities open, can you handicap a little bit where you are in your comfort level in getting all these open on time?
Jeff Kaminski
Stephen, I\'ll take that one. Yes, I think we\'re -- we\'ve been pretty accurate on the community count forecast as we\'ve done over the past number of years, actually. So we have a pretty good beat on it. The land is all controlled, obviously the ones we’re planning on opening, especially in the first part of the year development is well along the path and in some of those communities, it is just a matter of opening -- building the models and opening the community, so we\'re pretty confident with the community count numbers.
The largest variability we usually find is on the closeouts. So a stronger pace, more closeouts, lower community count, weaker pace, you have fewer close outs. So there\'s more variability on that side we find than on the grand openings. Occasionally, you\'ll see some pushback due to the weather or other external influences, but we normally get them opened. So, we\'re pretty confident on the ranges we gave for the quarter and for the year on that one.
Stephen East
Okay. All right. And then you talked a lot about the demand and traffic geographically and all that. It sounded like to me Jeff, your biggest issue was your community count in the Bay Area. I guess, I was wondering this morning with Lennar, we heard a little different, probably not as optimistic. And could you talk a little bit about what was happening in Southern California in Orange County, and they had sort of indicated that they thought it was -- that slowdown was filtering into the Inland Empire. And so, there\'s a compare and contrast here. I guess I\'m just really interested in a little bit more detail on what you think, you all are seeing in the market?
Jeff Mezger
Well, the Orange County market for us, Stephen, is a much smaller business, so we spend more time on the Bay area, because that\'s where we\'ve got a very good scale. And I would say that in Orange County we did see softening. I think our average price there is in -- it\'s not quite a million, but it\'s close, and we did see some softening in Orange County.
You have to assume if it\'s softening on the Coast it\'ll soften a little inland. We really didn\'t see it in the fourth quarter, we had a positive sales comp in both the Inland Empire and Central Cal centric outside of Sacramento it could be due to the price points that we operate in the inland areas because we stay focused in those areas on being affordable for that area and not just affordable relative to the Coast. So we\'ll keep an eye on it.
And the reason that I -- if you go up north, the reason I spent the time I did on the Bay Area is our -- when you sell out of a community that\'s selling well at $1.5 million or $1.7 million and you open up a townhome community at 800 to replace it, I don\'t want people to think that there has been a big price drop or some big shift in the Bay area marketplace because we\'re not seeing it. And I would say that at the affordable price points when you get up to the high price points I think throughout the system you\'re seeing some softening right now.

Our next question comes from line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Nishu Sood
Thank you. I wanted to ask about the share repurchases first. You folks have had some pretty opportunistic well-timed share repurchases in recent years as you\'ve been executing your return strategy. Should we think of the 4Q share repurchases as another such opportunistic purchase? Or is it something that might continue or with the priority with the uncertainty in the market be more towards debt repayment in 2019?
Jeff Mezger
Yes, I would say it was definitely opportunistic, Nishu. As we shared in our comments when you\'re trading at such a discount to book at the time it was one of the best returns on investment we could make for our shareholders. Our balanced approach that we\'ve been doing for years will continue in 2019 where we\'ll have a capital allocation strategy that is primarily focused on growing our business, growing our scale, growing our profitability, how do we support all that and at the same time continuing to strengthen the balance sheet.
So the good news for us as we have the capacity to do all those things now, and as Jeff showed in his comments we were expecting that we\'ll be reducing debt to $100 million here this year as part of that approach. But we\'ll stay balanced in whatever is the right thing to do for our shareholders.
Nishu Sood
Got it. Second thing, ASC 606, it looks like it took some out of SG&A and I\'m sorry -- out of the COGS line and put it into the SG&A line, so boost your gross margins and probably increased SG&A. Is that accounting effect just happen intra quarter or can it spread expenses across quarters. In other words is it -- would it have more of an effect later in the year or is it fairly equal quarter-by-quarter?
Jeff Kaminski
 Yes, it\'s a good question. I mean, there\'s a few dynamics related to it and right now obviously it involves all forecasting because we haven\'t reported an actual quarter yet. But you\'re effectively taking it\'s model expense for the most part that\'s the bulk of the reclassification for us. So you\'re taking model expenses that in the past would have been expensed on a per unit basis, right. Part of your cost to sales by on a unit basis and now you\'re moving those to basically fixed cost within SG&A and they follow more of an amortization schedule.
So there\'s two things that will happen, in a low volume quarter you tend to see a little more negative on the SG&A line than you do a pickup on the gross margin side. For the year in total they should more or less balance out. So in the first quarter where it\'s a lower volume quarter for us typically, we\'re expecting to potentially see a little bit of that impact maybe 10 to 20 bps of negative on balance. But we think that should more or less net out for the year and become mostly geography. 
Over time as we renew communities and open new communities under the new methodology will lose a little bit of that comparability to what it was before and what it is in the future, but for now that\'s kind of what we\'re seeing. And your observation was correct, I mean, that was a big driver of the lift in the gross margin and the -- also the higher SG&A costs in our first quarter guidance.

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. 
Christopher Shook
Hi. This is actually, Chris Shook, on for Steve. So during the course you increased your land spend 13% year-over-year. Was this number held back compared to what you were initially thinking? And also what kind of level of land spend should we think about directionally this year?
Jeff Kaminski
I mean, just like the rest of the full year, we really stopped guiding on full year land spend, I think a couple of years ago now. Because what we do as an alternative is we review deals on item by item basis every single deal gets reviewed and we know where our cash flow capability is and what we have coming in the operating side and then we make decisions on that basis.

So you see typical variability in our land spend. It mostly just relates to deal timing. When the deals are improved when you\'re ready to close a lot of the deals that we tie up are -- have contingent closings on certain things that the seller has to do either entitlement related or in some cases development related before we close. So it\'s more a function of just timing than anything.
Christopher Shook
Okay. Is it still within the kind of one to two year lifespan that you previously cited?
Jeff Kaminski
Yes. So, I mean, what we like to do is we\'d like to see all of our deals actually come to market and start producing revenues within one year if possible. Some of the development deals may go out a little further than that, but we try to keep that pretty tight. It tends to drive the best returns when you can do that.
Christopher Shook
Got it. And given the recent softening, have you seen any kind of degradational inland prices or are people still out at bidding?
Jeff Kaminski
It\'s a mix bag depending on which city you\'re in. We\'ve seen a little bit of softening. Nothing significant yet. Land sellers are pretty patient right now. And we\'re being patient with them. We have all the lots we need for 2019 and most of 2020 so we can take our time and only do deals that make sense and hit our strategy and hit our returns.

Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. 
John Lovallo
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. The first one is, Jeff, I think you mentioned that orders -- Jeff Mezger, I think you mentioned that orders in December were down 15% year-over-year also the toughest comp. Can you just remind us what December, January and February comps were?
Jeff Mezger
Yes. We really typically don\'t go out with monthly numbers. I mean, we just provide quarterly, Jeff want to provide a little bit of color on December to give a feel for the comp we were up against last year. But none of us going to comment any further on January. 
Jeff Kaminski
Yes. And we shared December because we have a full month. It is the softest time of the year. So the comps to me really don\'t suggest anything on market trends. Because the numbers are so small. But as I shared in the prepared remarks, the traffic levels held steady. And people are out there looking for homes. And where January, we\'re just barely into, one week into and it\'s a holiday week. So you don\'t want to get into that data, because it again is distorted, but so far we\'re encouraged with what\'s going on in January with our traffic and where the market is headed.
John Lovallo
Okay. And then maybe just dovetailing off to that in terms of the traffic being pretty steady. I mean, have you seen maybe the quality of that traffic improving more recently?
Jeff Mezger
I don\'t know that we can say that. Again it\'s anecdotal. I think our traffic was solid in December and it was followed in the fourth quarter and it\'s a good quality buyer. They\'re just kind of pausing to see if prices are going up, going down or rates going up or going down. It\'s a good time to buy a home or not. And they\'ve just paused a bit. So we\'re hopeful here as we head into the New Year and interest rates have come down that they see it\'s a great time to buy a house and they make their decisions quicker.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Dahl
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, I had a follow up to Nishu’s question on the reclassification. Can you -- is there a way for you to give us on your 2018 results if you had applied this change? What that would have done to gross margins and SG&A.
Jeff Kaminski
I guess, I\'d rather talk about the first quarter because we\'ve done a little bit more work on the first quarter. And obviously on the full year, which we won\'t talk about that. Round about right now you could look at the gross margin line and say I think it\'s going to be at least a 50 basis point uptick for the first quarter on the gross margin line and probably closer to 70 basis points in the SG&A line. That\'s as near as we could tell right now.

We could provide you guys more detail on that as the actual results come in, but like I said earlier we will lose a little bit of visibility to it on a particular on the gross margin side as we go deeper into the year because we\'ll know the reclassification into SG&A, but it disappears right out of the cost of sales. And every time you open a new community you don’t go and recount what would it have been on the costs of sales side. But I think in round numbers that probably gets you pretty close. And I don\'t think 2018 probably varies much from it.
Mike Dahl
Okay. Asked a slightly different way than just specific to 1Q, is that the only part that changed in your gross margin guide versus the 16% to 16.6%? 
Jeff Kaminski
I think we listed it 60 bit, so there was a little bit of mix and other factors maybe to the extent of 10 basis points or so. That was the bulk of the rise.
Mike Dahl
Okay. My second question is also circling back to, I think, kind of around what Alan and Steve were asking about earlier on some of the repositioning, but also the community count. And I forget if this came up in November, but when you\'re going to introduce these new smaller models, I think you called it existing floor plans, are these plans that have already been permitted for these communities or other instances where you\'re having to kind of push out a community opening because you have to go through any sort of re-permitting activities?
Jeff Mezger
It\'s a little bit of both, Mike, we have a product series that will have a broad range of footage. We get all the plans designed and introduced for that community and we\'ll get the planned check done on the whole series. But to go back in and get a permit dependent on the city may take a couple days or it could take a couple months depending on where you\'re at. We actually have delayed a couple of openings to retool where we decided, let’s rethink the product here and may have been a month or two delay, and that\'s we\'ve already absorbed that and we\'re off and running.
And what -- as I was walking through it in the comments, part of the message is this product is already done. We didn\'t have to go recreate anything, we could take it from our system. We move it from one city to another. We already know the take-offs, we already know what the buyers like and don\'t like and it\'s a plug and play environment. So we are able to move pretty quickly and our goal is to have everything out there here in the first quarter.
Mike Dahl
Okay. That\'s helpful. Thanks, Jeff.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please state with your question. 
Michael Rehaut
Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. First question, I just wanted to without trying to beat a dead horse on the slowest month of the year. It is obviously a lot of focus earlier in the day around your competitor\'s comments around the trends in December. If I heard you right, you basically were saying traffic was steady in December, in other words, no real change relative to November. And I presume that that there was also no change in incentives as a result. 
So I\'m just trying to get a sense obviously every company is different. But the optimism around the earlier statements was that the decline in interest rates that kind of occurred throughout the month did have some type of impact. Are you surprised that it didn\'t show up in at least the traffic numbers that you saw during the quarter or were there any other kind of signs that perhaps the tone did change or if it didn\'t why you think it might not have?
Jeff Mezger
Okay. Michael, let me correct something for you, the traffic I was referring to was year-over-year. So our December year-over-year was as solid as it was in both years and same in the fourth quarter. Our overall traffic levels are lower in December than they are in November stands to reason with the holiday period. And December for us we\'re open for business, we\'ll take every sale we can, we\'re not going to go chase the business. So if somebody across the street throws out incentives or whatever, we\'re not going to react in December because it\'s a very inelastic time of the year.

So our sales or our sales and I don\'t always view December it\'s really not a reflection on the market. You like the sales you get, but it\'s December. So as we come into January it\'s more critical to us especially now as the sales rate starts picking up week over week and you get into the selling season. It\'s a far better gauge of what\'s really going on out there.
And I think as interest rate tick down was late in December so I don\'t know it would have influenced your December traffic anyway. In January, as I shared we\'re encouraged with what we\'ve seen, but it\'s only a six or seven day period because you had the New Year\'s holiday in there. So we\'ll -- we\'re encouraged and hopeful and we like our position as things light up here in January.
Michael Rehaut
Fair enough, Jeff, I appreciate that. I guess, secondly just pointing clarification, you\'d mentioned that in the Inland Empire sales were up year-over-year. I just wanted to make sure was that just overall orders or also sales per community for the quarter?
Jeff Mezger
Both. 
Michael Rehaut
Both, it was great.

Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Please proceed you’re your question. 
Soham Bhosale
Good afternoon, everyone. This is Soham Bhosale, on for Jack today. So my first question was on gross margin and I know you\'re not providing guidance there, but maybe can you just talk through if your views have changed in any way on the organic leverage that you guys can pull to drive that higher year-over-year and maybe just comment on the better lumber pricing. When does that flow into gross margin this year?
Jeff Kaminski
Yes, I could give you some pluses and minuses I guess for the years as we look at it. I\'ll start on the negative side, so I could end on the positive side. On the headwind side, it\'s the typical headwinds we\'ve been seeing. I mean, you have potential material and contracted labor cost increases. So the inflation side is a bit unknown right now and it\'s been a headwind for several years now offset by pricing. But that still exist out there.
We have and expect to see a little bit of mix shift in the first quarter that could go a bit negative on us as we\'re trying to rebuild community count particularly in our Northern California business, we do believe that’ll correct as re-stabilize as we get later in the year and get some those communities open, but that will likely be a headwind early on and we did corporate that into our first quarter guidance of course.
And then there\'s a question mark on pricing power. Typically you see pretty strong pricing power at least we have seen it over the past several years, particularly during the spring selling season. If conditions remain choppy we\'ll see what we can take out of that if they strengthen and if the mortgage rate environment and the buyers come back strong that could turn a potential headwind into a tailwind for us. So that one\'s kind of in between.
On the positive side, absolutely right on the lumber pricing, we\'ve seen lumber prices come down pretty dramatically. We don\'t think we\'ll see much of that in the first quarter because we had most of those homes framed why we were still on our 13 week look back because we do average pricing on lumber, but that is a potential tailwind for us later in the year. Two other pretty significant tailwinds for us, one is the re-class obviously the 606 on it\'s a tailwind to margin and offset for the most part in the SG&A line. So that will be a factor on our overall GAAP gross margins in 2019.
And then finally fairly significantly we expect to continue to enjoy the benefit from our balance sheet strengthening and in the form of lower interest amortization. We\'re expecting a pickup of a minimum of 50 basis points for the full year and lower interest amortization and the impact that will have on margins. So that\'s there for us as well. So on balance those are sort of the pluses and minuses and things to consider I think as you look at our full year.

Soham Bhosale
So I just wanted to see in the prior guidance that you guys provided, did you bake in any level of incentives or was that just all organic?
Jeff Kaminski
To the extent, well again we\'re not a big incentive company, I mean, our incentives are typically less than a point. So they fluctuated probably this is our largest fluctuations we\'ve seen in a quarter, which is 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. So I would say there probably wasn\'t much of that baked in, in the upcoming year, [inaudible] price increased either.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Jay McCanless
Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. The first one I had, if we look back at 2018, the average backlog price declined fairly steadily each quarter through the year, but your average closing price held in, in a pretty tight range. And I know you all basically I think maintain the ASP, the average closing price guidance for 1Q, 2019. But at some point with you all going to a lower mix shift with your average backlog price coming down. Should we expect a gap down in prices? And if so is that a one quarter event, two quarter event? How are you all thinking about that?
Jeff Kaminski
Yeah as you were tracking it through the backlog for last year that the largest impact on that was really community count in some of the high price markets particularly the Bay area. That was the number one driver on the decline. So, again, we baked it into the guidance for the first quarter and we would contemplate it for the full year. We don\'t think we\'ll see ASP increase to the extent. I mean, look, the strategy of going smaller square footage and some of the mix shift that we have gone on the business, we think the ASP growth that we\'ve seen in prior years is probably not in the cards at the same level as we\'ve seen in the past. But it\'s not really a reflection of base market price.
Jay McCanless
Okay. The second question I had was…
Jeff Kaminski
So Jay, let me let me pick a couple of clarifying comments on that. I gave you the generic example of 1,800 to 2,400 now we come in with a 1,400 or 1,500 foot model or plan. It doesn\'t mean that the old plans aren\'t still available. And we call it moving with demand. If interest rates were to tick up and that\'s all a buyer can afford they may shift to a smaller plan. And if they do, you also have movement in how much they spend in the studio. So they may shift to a smaller plan, but spend more in the studio and your ASP could actually end up flat. We don\'t know.
So it\'s an insurance policy for us, but it\'s not like we\'re moving we\'ve taken away these other plans. So if interest rates stay down the buyer comes back like they were last year. They can still go right back to the larger plan and spend whatever they can afford in the studio. We\'re sharing it because it\'s a strategic move to insulate ourselves better if interest rates tick up understood.
Jay McCanless
Understood. And then on my second question, encouraged to hear that the community counts going to be moving up in several markets. But given the timing that you guys have talked about, can we expect any of these newer community openings to be a real earnings tailwind for 2019, or is this mostly just going to help out on the order side with most of the earnings growth coming in 2020?
Jeff Kaminski
No, I think to the extent we have a pretty good chunk of things in the first half of the year. We should see definite earnings coming off those communities in the back half. Typically first quarter openings are producing some revenue in the second quarter, but pretty solid revenues in the third and fourth quarter for sure. So, yes, we\'ll see some of it in 2019.

Our next question comes from line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. 
Matthew Bully
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the reactivated communities. So just given what we\'re seeing in the market kind of the deceleration in the broader market. Does that perhaps kind of change any thoughts around the reactivated communities? Is there any, I guess, additional sensitivity to what you\'d be seeing in the market in these particular communities that would manifest in margins or sales pace? And if so would there be, I guess any flexibility around future openings of these communities? Thank you.
Jeff Kaminski
Yes, in which direction are you thinking more opening more opening less?
Matthew Bully
I\'ll leave that up to you. 
Jeff Kaminski
Okay. Yes, I would say we\'re staying consistent in our strategy around the inactive assets. We\'re fairly aggressively opening communities. I mean, the fact right now is that within our inactive inventory the bulk of it we already have communities opened and they are basically next phases of currently open communities. So to the extent the market continues and we continue to sell and deliver out of those communities we\'re just naturally move into future phases of those communities.
And the handful of communities that have yet to be opened or where we never opened to single phase, we continue to work in some of those communities on the entitlement efforts and some of those communities in development efforts. And we continue -- we expect to continue with the strategy. I mean, we were very successful in 2018 and reduced our inactive inventory by $140 million. And it\'s had a very significant impact on the company mainly in the form of cash flow and incremental margin.
So we like the results of the strategy and we\'ll continue as long as the markets are to support it. Everything subject to market conditions, but we don\'t at this point see anything in the market conditions that would suggest that we change our strategy.
Matthew Bouley
Okay, appreciate that color. And then secondly, just following up on the questions around the repositioning maybe asked a bit of a different way, have you actually made the square footage offerings on a meaningful scale in any of your existing communities? And if so, could you provide I guess so far what if any impact you\'ve seen, any kind of tangible effects on sales pace with those products or perhaps on the margin side thus far? Thank you.
Jeff Mezger
Matthew, we\'re still -- we\'re early in the rollout. We have introduced the product as a finished and decorative model in communities, different footages in different city. They are selling well and if you think about it it\'s part of the challenge is in smaller footage offer the same livability, three bedroom into three bedroom, great room to great room, not size of a kitchen. And we work hard in the smaller footages to get rid of dead space and wasted space so they live as well. And we are seeing the consumer respond to it. So it\'s early fill and we like the initiative and we think we can really help our business.

Jade Rahmani
Thanks very much. Just in terms of land spend, can you give any color on what you\'re spending on average per lot currently? Or otherwise since it varies by market maybe indicate what the percentages of ASP and if that\'s changed at all from a year ago?
Jeff Kaminski
Yes. I don\'t have those stats right on hand, but I mean you can calc. You could see our lot changed particularly when the 10-K comes out, you could see the change in lots and the spend on new communities or our new land -- land acquisition. But yes, I apologize, I don\'t have those numbers on hand here. 

Jade Rahmani
Do you have any color on what drove the impairment in the quarter?
Jeff Kaminski
There was a small handful of community. There was part of the total inventory related charged almost $1 million it was just abandonments of land deals that we had in the pipeline that we decided when either meet our hurdle requirements or there were other risk factors associated with it, I think we had 10 abandonments that were booked in the community in the quarter and we had about five impairments kind of spread across the business.
Jade Rahmani
Okay. And just lastly did you contemplating any change in spec strategy?
Jeff Mezger
Spec on the inventory. 
Jade Rahmani
Yes. You plan to build more specs in order to drive volume.
Jeff Mezger
No, our inventory homes are the toughest homes for us to sell. We believe in built order. We\'ve done it for 20 years. We think it\'s the right way to go and we\'ll continue to reinforce those values.
