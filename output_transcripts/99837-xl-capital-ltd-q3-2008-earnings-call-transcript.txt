Operator
Welcome everyone to XL Capital\'s investor conference call.  (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to David Radulski, XL Capital\'s Director of Investor Relations.
David Radulski
Welcome to our call.  This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL\'s website at www.XLcapital.com.  We posted to our website a press release and slide presentation.  Since we\'re holding this call sooner after the quarterend than usual, the results are estimated and preliminary and, in the case of some information, bounded by a range.
We intend to post other documents to our website, including our financial supplement and structured credit supplement at a later date.  We do not anticipate holding another earnings conference call this quarter.  On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Capital\'s CEO, will offer opening remarks.  Brian Nocco, our CFO, will comment on certain financial items.  He will be followed by Sarah Street, XL\'s Chief Investment Officer, who will discuss our investment portfolio.  David Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations, and James Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will review current P&C market conditions.  We will then open it up for your questions before returning to Mike McGavick for closing remarks.
Now, it\'s not our practice to update guidance on a quarterly basis, so nothing today should be construed as either updating or affirming previously provided guidance.  Certain of the matters we\'ll discuss today are forwardlooking statements.  These statements are based on current plans, estimates, and expectations.  Forwardlooking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements.  Forwardlooking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent annual report on Form 10K, our quarterly reports on Form 10Q, and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements.  Forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forwardlooking statement in response to new information, future developments, or otherwise.  With that, I will turn it over to XL\'s CEO, Mike McGavick.
Mike McGavick
Our week last week was instructive on the dangers of market rumors in a time of panic.  In the end, I expect it will be illustrative of not much more.  By the end of the week and into today, we\'ve seen confidence of all concert moving back towards XL.  And we believe this confidence is justified.  I would like to share a recent experience that I think puts the last week in perspective.  Last Monday, we quoted on a piece of U.S. insurance business that was new to us in response to a broker query.  Wednesday, the broker called to express concern given the volatility in our share price that day.  But by late Friday, after we released our preliminary book value and investment portfolio data and after S&P affirmed our financial strength trading at A plus, the broker called again, this time to buying the business.  

We are holding this call earlier than we normally would, in part because of situations like this.  The fact is that we have seen significant sales momentum throughout the quarter since we announced our resolution of our financial guarantee business SCA, now known as Syncora.  While that was briefly interrupted last week, we expect that momentum to continue.  
We want to share a little bit about what we achieved during the quarter and how positive we feel about our underlying business.  I think it\'s best to look at our achievements through the prism of what this management team said it would do when we assembled earlier this year.  We said we had three priorities:  To end our foray into the financial guarantee business, to strengthen our enterprise risk management, and to work with discipline to improve the regard we are held in, especially with the rating agencies.  We believe we have made stride in all respects.  The most important of the action remains the one earliest announced.  We eliminated the vast majority of our exposure to SCA, now known as Syncora, and market questions related to that exposure ended shortly thereafter, and our sales momentum was reestablished.  
In enterprise risk management, we made significant progress in derisking our investment portfolio, which we established as a high priority, and which Sarah Street will address in a bit.  We initiated our strategic review of our life reinsurance operations, and we expect to conclude that review during this quarter.  And we demonstrated our better attention to risk management across the firm by virtue of taking what we believe will be market share or less losses in the hurricanes recently experienced.  We also added Jacob Rosengarten from Goldman Sachs to lead our efforts in enterprise risk management.  Again, progress.  
Finally, with respect to the latter, the idea that we should improve the recognition of the strength of XL, we made a conscious decision, in fact, some of the questions in our last call were about this, to the negative, I might add.  We made a conscious decision to raise more capital than was required just by the Syncora settlement.  We did so, we said, because there was continuing noise in our investment portfolio and because we were entering hurricane season.  And we viewed it as prudent.  It certainly did prove to be prudent.  In the end, as we end the quarter, we remain of a belief that we are both wellcapitalized relative to our rating agency requirements, and that we have completed these actions in a timely manner.  At the same time, we also were able to reduce our company\'s expense base, while achieving modest premium growth.  
I mentioned S&P\'s announcement affirming our financial strength rating at A plus, which came in Friday.  In particular, we appreciate that S&P noted that affirmation reflects XL\'s strong coverage of both interest and fixed charges.  Obviously, this is an area of real interest in the market.  Given the questions on capital strength and liquidity, I would like Brian Nocco to lead us off.
Brian Nocco
My comments will focus principally on capital and liquidity.  XL remains in a strong capital position, aided by our financing activity in conjunction with the Syncora resolution.  As we told you then, we intended to provide for a buffer against volatility in the capital markets in particular as we enter the U.S. wind season.  Given the extraordinary events that have unfolded in the financial markets and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, we are certainly glad that we raised the capital we did.  Our book value this quarter is estimated to be in a range of $21.50 to $21.65 per share.  The main drivers for the change in book value per share for the quarter arose from our capital raise and the Syncora payment.  

Our pro forma book value at June 30, 2008, after these two items, is approximately $26.20 per share.  You can find detail on our book value per share calculations in the slides posted to our website this morning.  
In the third quarter, we also saw decline in asset values in our investment portfolio, with a mark to market of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion, of which OTTI is in a range of $250 million to $275 million and realized losses and security sales are $40 million.  Sarah will address these in greater detail in a moment.  Meanwhile, we continue our strategic review of our life reinsurance business.  Alternatives available to us include a possible sale, and we expect to conclude our review in the coming few months.  Now to liquidity.
Our liquidity position remains strong.  Capital activities in the third quarter raised approximately $3.3 billion in cash.  After making payments relating to Syncora and the early redemption of private placement notes, we had over $1 billion remaining to add to our available cash on hand.  Our [munis] were paid off earlier that year.  And funding agreements are down to approximately $850 million.  With the only maturities in the next four quarters being $250 million coming due in December for which we have set aside liquid assets.  We also continue to record strong underwriting and investment cash flows.  
The revolving credit facilities which support our business aggregate over $7 billion.  These facilities are used for the issuances of letters of credit with approximately $3.2 billion outstanding.  With the ability to directly borrow up to $1 billion under these LC facilities, we do not anticipate the need to do so at this time or anytime in the foreseeable future.  They contain no adverse change clauses or other provisions that we believe are likely to prevent our usage of the facilities.  Our two largest facilities, for $2.35 billion and $4 billion, do not expire until mid2010 and 2012, respectively.  In summary, we believe XL currently enjoys a very healthy capital and liquidity position.  
Finally, foreign exchange effects in the quarter were driven by significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major European currencies.  In aggregate, this had the impact of reducing our capital by $250 million as reflected in three scenarios of our financial statements.  First, we recorded an FX gain of $140 million in the income statement.  Second, the movement in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio benefited by $67 million.  Finally, we recorded a reduction of capital of $457 million direct to AOCI on the balance sheet.  Given our global franchise, fluctuations of this sort may be expected in the course of operations.  Now to Sarah Street.
Sarah Street
I refer you to the slides we posted on our website for more detail on what I will be discussing this morning.  As David mentioned, we intend to post our typically formatted disclosures as soon as that data is complete and verified.  I will expand it to give more detail on our corporate portfolio.  We have included some detailed information in today\'s slides on holdings in financials, as we felt it was appropriate to give a high level of transparency in this area given the current stresses in the capital markets.  
Regarding the fourth quarter, while we saw some benefits principally from interest rate movements, the widening of corporate credit spreads to historic, or near historic, levels, especially in financials, drove the bulk of our $1.1 to $1.15 billion in mark to market.  As you know, XL does not price any of the investments in our portfolio.  This is done by independent, thirdparty pricing providers.  When they price our portfolio, they use market pricing or comparable trade activity.  That is the number we report whether we agree or not with what a liquid market is saying our investments are currently worth.  We do not overwrite or change any of these independent evaluations.  We have done detailed due diligence on the processes used by these pricing providers in determining our evaluations.  And have satisfied ourselves that they are both appropriate and give us credible prices on which to value our assets.  

Most of the market challenges around prices is in the structured credit area, as corporates are generally easier to value.  While we will be taking between $250 million and $275 million in OTTI, our process indicates that the balance of our securities in the portfolio are money good and we have both the intent and the ability to hold them until recovery.  Included in this OTTI charge is between $115 million and $130 million related exposures to financial institutions including impairments on names like Lehman, Washington Mutual, Fannie and Freddie preferred, as we have previously announced.  
The remaining OTTI is spread across the portfolio including structured credit, equity, and other fixed income.  Between $60 million and $70 million will be related to subprime and Alt-A.  We have further enhanced our already robust OTTI process in the third quarter.  There has been even more granular process than we have historically done and obviously with increased attention on evaluating assets that are priced at significant discounts.  
As you know, we do not have any formulaic approach to OTTI, but our approach is done on a securitybysecurity basis where pricing indicates credit deterioration and on structured credit where performance characteristics of the underlying collateral pools would indicate potential impairment.  This quarter, we continue to be actively engaged with our managers in this process in satisfying ourselves that their evaluations and conclusions are both robust and appropriate.  We have continued to derisk our portfolio during the quarter.  We decided early in the quarter to sell our Fannie and Freddie preferred positions as well as a number of regional banks and even what little Icelandic bank holdings we had.  Most of this was accomplished prior to the Lehman bankruptcy when credit markets became even more disrupted.  
We sold down nearly $800 million of our CMBS portfolio in the quarter, taking a modest $21 million loss but reducing our exposure on an amortized basis by 25%.  Our subprime, Alt-A, CMBS, and CDO holdings reduced by approximately $150 million from June 30 through natural cash flows.  Yes, many of these bonds are still paying down on a quarterly basis.  We have concentrated the majority of our subprime and Alt-A portfolios with a single specialist manager with the clear mandate to manage down the risk in this portfolio and improve the quality over time in an orderly manner.  We have also reduced our corporate credit holdings by approximately $500 million.  This reduction was spread across sectors and the rating spectrum, but includes financials and triple B holdings.  
It included $150 million of targeted sales that we made in the regional banks, as well as consumer cyclical credit and other issuers that we identified as more vulnerable.  We have provided in the slides a listing by name of all exposures above $50 million in amortized cost to financial institutions.  These exposures are spread across large global firms that have both big balance sheets and strong franchises.  As we note in the slides, $2.2 billion of our $5.1 billion in financials is held in the life portfolio.  As we continue our strategic analysis of the life reinsurance business, it\'s important to note that the assets associated with that business are more heavily weighted towards longerterm debt from financial institutions, including tier 1 and tier 2 paper.  It currently accounts for $600 million of our unrealized loss.  Approximately [4, 40?]% of our overall sensitivity to both interest rate and credit risk is related to the life portfolio despite these portfolios accounting for only 17% of total assets.  Our individual issuer framework, exposure framework, that we use to manage our credit aggregation risk has insured that we are not overly exposed to any one issuer.  In addition, we have further reduced our interest rate risk by shortening the duration of the P&C portfolio by 0.3 years.  We have increased our cash and government agency holdings by $2 billion to $12.8 billion and this now represents 37% of our fixed income portfolio.  

On the tactical side, and in response to current market conditions, we have taken a number of steps to reduce risk.  We moved threequarters of our money market liquidity into governmentonly assets.  We capped our secured lending activities at $300 million.  Current levels are well below this cap.  The collateral supporting the program is very diversified and of high quality.  We have remained underinvested in our risk portfolio.  Since the beginning of the year, we have actively reduced both the size of our equities and our alternative portfolios by approximately 23% and 13%, respectively.  
These collective actions have had the impact of reducing our sensitivity to credit spreads and interest rates by approximately 15% and 10%, respectively.  Finally, our alternative portfolio generated negative returns of 4.2% or a loss of $78 million in the quarter, of which $61 million equity accounted from flow through the P&L.  This was partially offset by $7 million of positive performance in our private investment portfolio.  While disappointing on an absolute basis, these results, which include three months through the end of August, compare favorably to the equity markets in that period.  
Looking ahead to the rules that we release in the fourth quarter, the month of September was clearly a difficult one for the alternative industry.  Preliminary estimates indicate that we are at the favorable end of industry ranges which have seen declines between 5% and 8% for the month.  This means that approximately 5% on a $1.9 billion of investments of which approximately $1.5 billion is [equity] accounted.  In the fourth quarter and beyond, we intend to continue repositioning of our investment portfolio to build upon the progress to date.  We are concentrated on reducing our exposure to lowerrated credit, to financials, as well as to top [fill] assets like subprime, Alt-A, and then CMBS and CDOs, and dampening the portfolio\'s impact on the book value volatility.  
To finish, our investment portfolio at the end of September was a total of $36.7 billion, of which $33.4 billion is held in fixed income with an average credit quality of AA.  It is highly diversified across both asset class and issuer, and it\'s trending towards higher credit quality and the more traditional asset classes with higher liquidity.
Mike McGavick
As you can see, we continue to make progress in the derisking of our investment portfolio.  And I believe we will continue to do so.  Another way in which making this company less risky to its owners was intended to see better underwriting results, and I want to talk about the underwriting results which we will now turn to.
XL is a company that takes large risks.  We believe we get well paid to do so.  I think in a way, this quarter demonstrates that.  While this will be a quarter of higher losses, in a year when we have seen higherthanaverage, large losses, particularly in the property arena, we\'re not less than pleased when we look at the fact that as we come to this point in the year, our operating ROE is 10.8%.  Including all that has gone on.  
We think continuing to deliver a doubledigit operating ROE at this point, with these events, is a number we\'re actually quite proud of.  I would point out another element of these losses, which I alluded to in my opening.  One of the questions that has come to us is have we really gotten rid of these larger losses?  If you look back over the last eight years or so, you would have seen five sources of large losses.  Two are acquisitionrelated, we\'ve already said that\'s not something we\'re looking to do, these large, large acquisitions.  One, a strategic mistake was getting into a business we shouldn\'t have been in, SCA.  We won\'t be doing that.  We\'re refocusing the business instead.  Then, two, that were related to us having largerthanmarket share of losses that occurred in extreme situations.  One with the World Trade Center and one with respect to KRW.  

The first test of that focused enterprise risk management in our underwriting arena took place with Ike.  When we look at Ike and Gustav during the quarter, we\'re very pleased with the losses we look relative to our market share as we view the size of that storm to be.  That indicates I think that piece, too, is under better control and presents a better risk to our owners and shareholders.  So, with that, I want to turn this over to Dave Duclos, who will comment on our insurance results.
Dave Duclos
When looking at our insurance results this quarter, you will see two clear outcomes.  First, our profitability has been adversely impacted by loss activity this quarter, both by natural catastrophes and large losses primarily in the property line.  The second outcome relates to our topline gross premiums written result which reflects the strong endorsement we received from brokers and clients.  Let\'s first take a look at our key profit levers.  The insurance segment generated a loss ratio of 79.8% in a combined ratio of 107.9% in the quarter.  These results were impacted by favorable prior year development of $12 million.  
Natural cat losses, net of reinstatement premiums, were $69 million, which included $90 million from Gustav and Ike and favorable movements in reserves on other 2008 natural cat events.  We also saw in Q3 the continuation of large property losses, which impacted the industry and our segment results.  It\'s important to state that these are losses we would expect to incur periodically, given the business we write and must be considered as we look at our pricing, retention, and new business strategies for the immediate future.  
The last profit metric to comment on is our underwriting expense ratio.  When you normalize this result for nonrecurring items, Q3 2008 was actually slightly lower than prior year, coming in at 26.2% versus 26.7%.  Our gross premium written result was consistent with what we\'ve seen in previous quarters this year, showing growth at 3.8% compared to Q3 2007.  On a yeartodate basis, we are now at 1.5% ahead of prior year.  Again, given the market conditions and SCA noise, as Mike alluded to earlier, this results validates our strategy and is a clear indication of the value our brokers and clients place on our franchise.  It is important to note that this outcome was the result of strong customer retention, pricing which was slightly better than projected in prior year results, and successfully writing targeted new business that supports our profit goals.  We are growing by offering products that built upon and expand our existing core portfolio and by thoughtfully expanding the global platform from which they are delivered.  This product segment, geography expansion, is achieved through leveraging our technical underwriting insight, risk engineering capabilities and claims performance in a way that is of value to our clients and brokers.  
Before passing this over to Jamie to cover our reinsurance results, given the recent market events, it is appropriate to quickly touch on our D&O book and the subprime exposure that we\'ve addressed in previous calls.  After completing our subprime analysis for the quarter, which reflects industry and segment data and trends, we are making no changes to prior year reserves for the 2008 loss ratio, which we increased by 5 points as was communicated in our Q1 call.  Important to note that for events like this, we monitor developments carefully.  Ensuring that our underwriting, actuarial, and claims teams are closely linked as we assess both our results and industry data.  Now to Jamie.
Jamie Veghte
The reinsurance segment produced a acceptable result in the quarter despite significant natural catastrophe activity and continued competition in both the primary and reinsurance sectors of the market.  The segment had a loss ratio of 78.4% and a combined ratio of 105.4% on net premiums earned of $483 million.  These results were impacted by catastrophe losses net of reinstatement premiums of $133 million from Gustav and Ike.  Offset by favorable prior year releases of $88 million.  Absent these factors and other natural cats in the quarter, our loss ratio would have been 66.4%.  

You will note our gross premiums written grew in the quarter by 10% from $624 million to $686 million.  This resulted from two principal sources.  A spike in premiums from our agricultural portfolio, which is impacted by underlying commodity prices, and a timing adjustment on a proportional treaty, which did not renew at its normal anniversary date in the first quarter.  Perhaps more reflective of the reality of current trading conditions is our net premiums earned, which dropped by 15% to $483 million from the third quarter of 2007.  As you know, the July 1 renewals are a very busy one for the U.S. catastrophe business.  During that renewal session, we saw the rate of price declines slow to around 5% on a risk-adjusted basis, from 10% to 15% that we reported on during the first two quarters.  In addition, there\'s been a clear increase in demand for U.S. wind capacity.  In some cases, availability of capacity did not meet this demand.  We would expect this trend to continue particularly in view of the third quarter losses to the market.  This would auger well for our January 1 renewals.  
As I mentioned in our last quarterly call, we were gratified with the response of our customers and brokers to the SCA situation.  As we said previously, the impact on premium was very minor.  The reduction in our topline continues to be the result of our underwriting discipline and the appetite among our clients to increase retention.  This is a scene we have discussed over the last couple of years.  Our life reinsurance operations contributed $38 million in the quarter, an increase of $11 million over 2007.  Gross premiums written associated with this book increased by 11% to $156 million.  The growth came principally from our portfolios in the U.K. and Ireland, but we did see some development from our U.S. platform.  With that, I will turn it back over to Mike.
Mike McGavick
I think it\'s appropriate at this point, too, to offer a little bit of color commentary around the market.  With very significant catastrophe activity in the quarter, and with also the significant effects on capitalization by virtue of these historic gyrations in the economy, this is all we think, and we see signs.  This is all pointing to a better environment for the property and casualty industry.  So, while we not only are pleased with the momentum in terms of new sales and business we\'re looking at right now, we\'re also pleased with the market conditions and feel well positioned to take advantage of them.
QuestionandAnswer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tom Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs.
Tom Cholnoky  Goldman Sachs
Number one, Sarah, can you give us some idea of what the percentage carrying value, when you\'re looking at your structured credit portfolio, you obviously are derisking.  But what the percentage carrying value is of original par.  I don\'t know if you have that available, but hopefully you do.  If you don\'t, if you could disclose that because I think that would be very helpful.  This is my first question.
Sarah Street
I can give you some facts upon some of the different asset clauses because within structured credit, that covers a very broad range of different assets.
Tom Cholnoky  Goldman Sachs
Looking at slide 15.  If you can address slide 15.
Sarah Street
I don\'t have it on an aggregate basis, but let me give you the total unrealized on our structured credit portfolio.  Is $1.4 billion.
Tom Cholnoky  Goldman Sachs
And the total impairments?  Would that include impairments?
Sarah Street
That\'s after impairments.  That\'s remaining unrealized.  To give you some idea of the type of prices that we have pricings at, the subprime portfolio in aggregate, remember this is heavily weighted towards the higherrated credit.  Is at a price of about 67 cents on the dollar.  This ranges, pretty dramatically by vintage and by ratings, but that\'s the average level.  Our Alt-A portfolio is actually priced at a slightly worse level than our subprime at this point.  It\'s at $0.63.  Our core CLOs are marked at an average of $0.65.  Our CMBS is about 88¢ on the dollar.


Tom Cholnoky  Goldman Sachs
As you go through the queue, it would be very helpful if we could get the par value of that to truly understand these marks. 
Two other quick questions.  Can somebody give us an update of where SCA is in trying to commute the European bank exposure, that $1.1 billion?
Mike McGavick
There have been continuing discussions on that.  There has not been progress on that yet.
Tom Cholnoky  Goldman Sachs
Is there still a time frame that we\'re looking for to hopefully get that done or not?
Mike McGavick
We have never established a time frame around that.  The view was to discontinue to pursue it, but we continue to view the risks as relatively benign.
Tom Cholnoky  Goldman Sachs
Last question.  Is there any parts of, even though looks like S&P hasn\'t firmed your rating, but just in case, if you were to get downgraded, are there any rating sensitive collateral requirements that you have in any of your business lines?
Brian Nocco
There are, but they cut in at very low levels.  Essentially, we would have to be downgraded to the triple D category.  Or an AFS, the B category for those to have any material impact.
Tom Cholnoky  Goldman Sachs
So below Aminus is where it would kick in?
Brian Nocco
That\'s correct.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital. 
Jay Gelb  Barclays Capital
My question revolves around the, if we look at the current stock price relative to your outlook for how\'s your reported book value or even estimate of tangible book value, there\'s a huge disconnect in the market it appears.  It seems that leads you to probably one or two things.  Either the market has it completely wrong in terms of looking at the stock price, or there\'s a significant concern out there about more losses coming through the balance sheet or maybe the requirement for more capital.  Mike, can you address that disconnect?
Mike McGavick
Last week, we saw some significant and very negative and wrong rumors with respect to our situation.  Just to put it in order of magnitude.  We saw rumors that were many multiples of what we took in OTTI and many multiples of what we took in the marks.  Given the jitteriness of the markets last week, it was a bad time to have a set of rumors like that out there.  We saw them become a very significant disconnect, that\'s true.  We view it as a disconnect.  And we hope that, by providing the true data out into the market, and including the very broad disclosures we\'re making with respect to our investment portfolio, will go a long way to curing for that disconnect.  Let\'s remember that these rumors really kind of burst to the front on Wednesday.  And Wednesday night, coincidentally, I am not complaining about this, it\'s just observable.  You also had the short selling bath come off.  I can\'t imagine that was helpful to name around whom there were rumors swirling at that particular moment.  That is all moment in time stuff.  In the end, the truth is what endures and given the way in which we\'re derisking this investment portfolio, given the strategic options that we have ahead of us, we\'re comfortable with where we are.  And we\'ll just keep soldiering on.
Jay Gelb  Barclays Capital
What are the prospects for additional substantial investment marks in the fourth quarter?  And could that impair XL\'s capital position and require more capital to be raised?

Mike McGavick
We\'ve come to the conclusion that, while we have a number of alternatives, that we do not need to raise capital.  We believe, as I said earlier, that we are well capitalized.  Particularly relative to the requirement of our rating agencies.  I will make the point, by the way, parenthetically, that we have had one rating agency comment already and we and you are waiting for the others to comment.  I don\'t mean to assert that I know what they\'re going to do.  Just that how we view our capitalization.  Now, a question like that, you are looking forward into the future.  I would observe a few things.  First, that\'s a mouthful to think about a quarter like this quarter.  A quarter that ended on historic high credit spreads with rising interest rates at the same time and with historical cats in the same quarter.  That\'s a mouthful and one would have to be a pessimist indeed to think that\'s how the next quarter goes.  

That said, there\'s a number of variables relative.  And opportunities relative to our position.  We mentioned several times, and I don\'t mean to overharp on it, but we do have this lifere strategic exploration that\'s been going on in a methodical way.  We are of the belief that will conclude during this quarter.  And you\'ve heard some of the effects this business has within the investment portfolio itself.  You heard about the derisking of the investment portfolio, which is also a meaningful point.  I think about that derisking the investment portfolio in the context of all of the government actions we see around this.  I think all of our belief that at some point, these actions gain traction.  
Then, finally, you remember that we have strong capital generated by our operating businesses.  And as we\'re entering a quarter that is less prone to significant catastrophe, I do not mean to tempt God by that statement, we see ourselves as being in a good position to get through what comes at us.

Operator
Your next question comes from Lee Cooperman of Omega Advisors.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors
I think you have addressed most of my points, but I guess at my age, I like things to be repeated sometimes.  You\'re saying at this point in time.  There\'s really three area of questions.  That there\'s no need for additional equity capital, as best as you can tell.  And the second question is your predecessors used to talk in terms of 15% ROE as a target.  I am just wondering, given your assessment of the conditions in the market, the trend in the conditions in the market, whether that\'s a reasonable objective for 2009 and any color you can give would be appreciated.
Mike McGavick
With respect to the first question, that\'s correct.  We do not see any reason for us to raise capital at this time.  With respect to the second question on ROE, we have always said that 15% ROE is a projection of our earnings potential over the cycle.  As you know, these have been weaker days in the pricing cycle.  That said, I have also made the comment earlier that we believe that conditions in the marketplace are actually turning more favorable more rapidly than we had earlier expected, given what\'s occurred during this quarter.  Where exactly that will lead us, we don\'t get into that kind of specific projections.  We have said all along, even at the bottom of the cycle, we expected to be in doubledigit ROE.  We expect the average over the course of the cycle to be at 15% ROE level.  We stand by that today, too.

Your next question comes from Josh Shanker - Citigroup.
Josh Shanker  Citigroup
The first question involves you describing your cash in relationship to 2009 debt coming due.  I know there\'s a credit facility as well as a 2.53% yield debt that comes due.  I want you to talk about your comfort level that you\'ll be able to pay principal and what you plan to do, whether you are trying to raise debt to replace that.  That\'s my first question.
Brian Nocco
I think you\'re referring to the equity security units and the debt component associated with that.  That\'s essentially self-funding because it has accompanying it equity units which will generate cash when those automatically convert into common equity.  That cash comes into company and then become used to retire that debt.  We have indicated it\'s our intention to retire the debt with that cash.  We don\'t have any material debt beyond that coming due next year.
Josh Shanker  Citigroup
There\'s the letter of credit, though, yes?  About maybe $850 million?  I don\'t know what it is right now, but you just draw down about $600 million of that?
Brian Nocco
We\'ve got various letter of credit facilities as I indicated in total that are in excess of $7 billion.  In point of fact, there\'s $7.3 billion.  We\'ve got far less than half of those outstanding, so we have, quite frankly, a lot of flexibility to cut back on our letter of credit facilities if we choose to do so.  The minor LC roll next year is really not much of an issue for us.

Josh Shanker  Citigroup
The other question is, can you talk about, when you say we have no specific way of viewing any given security about when AOCI and unrealized losses become OTTI.  Do the rating agencies have more constructive opinions on that for you to deal with or are they comfortable with your assessments of when you think something is other than temporarily impaired.
Sarah Street
We have spent, as I am sure you would expect, a lot of time with the rating agencies on our OTTI process and what we do.  And going through also working extremely closely with PWC.  And, I think every quarter, have enhanced our process in terms of making it even more robust in terms of the analysis that we\'re doing on a securitybysecurity basis.  I have not been given any views that people are uncomfortable with what we\'re doing.
Josh Shanker  Citigroup
Do the rating agencies have guidelines?  I realize you\'re saying we don\'t have guidelines.  Have they given any weight at all with information what they think you should be trying to do?

Sarah Street
No.  It\'s management\'s decision.

Your next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\'Neill. 
Paul Newsome  Sandler O\'Neill
I was hoping you could step back and, given the current environment, talk about ultimately where you want to take your investment portfolio in terms of the risk makeup.  I don\'t mean necessarily what is going to happen next quarter, but in a broader sense, to give us a sense of where the process ultimately will end up?  If you could tie in just how critical that is to the strategic decision with the life reinsurance business.  Maybe talk about apparently there\'s essentially two separate portfolios there and could you talk to us a little bit more about that as well.
Mike McGavick
First, with respect to our objectives.  I have stated this before.  We want to have a investment portfolio that is more traditional, that would be viewed as very much in keeping with or similar to our competitors in the property and casualty space.  Because what we want to talk about, we want the focus to remain on our underwriting prowess, which is where we think investors are really focused on.  This gives us our north star for the entire derisking strategy.  I will ask Sarah to comment further on that in a moment.  That\'s the first point.  
The second point is, if you\'re going to be in the lifere business as well and you are going to be in some other classes that would not be traditional to that.  The fact that we\'re seeking to be more traditional does increase our curiosity about what our strategic options are with respect to our lifere business and you heard some statistics from Sarah about the disproportionate degree of risk that particular portfolio contains relative to the rest and relative to what would be a traditional P&C portfolio.  So that remains the direction we are taking.  
Remember, also, that the reason we\'re in this particular position is because we were in a number of other businesses.  Frankly, it\'s my judgment, having the benefit of hindsight, that we wish we hadn\'t been in.  So whether the [muni] business and these others.  Those are kind of the residual asset classes that we\'re working our way out of in a disciplined way.  Those are kind of three pieces of color commentary, but I would ask Sarah to be more specific.
Sarah Street
As Mike said, the first derisking is the exit out of the financial lines business.  We still own some of those assets.  And that\'s one of the key things that we need to work our way out of.  Those asset classes are a large portion of our subprime and Alt-A exposure, as well as our core CDO portfolio, which is principally CLOs at this point.  We never owned a lot of the assetbacked CDOs, but we do are the CLO portfolio, which you do not typically see on a P&C portfolio.  You do see them in spread businesses.  That would be the first aspect.  Mike covered on the life business, the life portfolio is more sensitive to both credit and interest rates because of its longer duration.  That\'s where that sensitivity comes and I gave statistics earlier.  

When we look at our core P&C portfolio, that has actually really performed  relatively well through this crisis.  That gets lost in the noise of the financial lines.  But even within that, we will looking to reduce the risk and that\'s principally focused on less lowerrated credit.  We have made some big progress on that this quarter.  But I think you will see less triple Bs on an ongoing basis.  I think you are likely to see the size of our risk assets to come down slightly.  We\'re looking at resizing that and looking at all of the different components within there.  We haven\'t made any decisions on that yet.  But we\'re working hard of it.  And then, our CMBS portfolio, which we felt was outsized relative to the core other P&C businesses.  We would look to bring that down in significant size and have already accomplished a lot of that this quarter.  
In terms of what goes up, talked about what goes down.  I think you will see an increasing over time in munis as our U.S. business principally on the insurance side grows in size.  That gives us more taxable profits in the U.S., so therefore earning more munis makes sense.  Munis are less volatile in themselves.  They\'re not as sensitive to interest rates.  Finally, I think you are see us owning more governments and agencies over time.  Those are the key areas that we\'re focused on and gives you hopefully some idea of where we\'re trying to get to long term.

Your next question comes from Josh Smith with TIAACREF.
Josh Smith  TIAACREF
Most of my questions have been asked, but I want to follow up on some questions.  Specifically with regard to the rating agencies.  There have been some research reports out there that have highlighted the fact that you have had some large unrealized losses and equated unrealized loss with a need to replace dollar for dollar equity capital.  How is it that you think that the rating agencies are viewing unrealized losses because typically on the life side anyway, they aren\'t necessarily equated it dollar for dollar unrealized loss with the need for capital.  Historically, P&C has been looked at more including unrealized losses, but certainly life is different.  If you could speak to what your perception is from the rating agencies with respect to increase in unrealized losses particularly if it was related to just a widening of corporate spreads.
Brian Nocco
We\'ve been in very active discussions with our rating agencies, as you might suspect.  I think it\'s fair to say that they\'re trying to figure it out.  This is unprecedented times.  We\'ve seen movements in interest rates.  We\'ve seen unprecedented moves in credit spreads to levels that none of the market professionals think are reflective of intrinsic or economic value for many of these securities.  I think as a result of that, there is a heightened focus on OTTI as opposed to unrealized in the portfolio is a better reflection of economic loss.  While I can\'t speak for the rating agencies, they will speak for themselves, I do think that\'s an element that they\'re increasingly focusing on because of the aberrant markets that we\'re in.
Josh Smith  TIAACREF
Do you think that OTTI is more reflective of potential capital hit than the actual unrealized loss itself?

Brian Nocco
We certainly do in the long run.

Your next question comes from Alain Karaoglan with Banc of America.
Alain Karaoglan  Banc of America
Brian, you went quickly over the liquidity at the holding company.  Could you please repeat what you said in terms of cash or liquidity that you have at the holding company in terms of either the capital that you raised that\'s remaining or others.  Whether you have any plans to contribute that to the insurance companies or you plan to keep it there.
Brian Nocco

I didn\'t speak to the holding company per se.  I talked to liquidity overall.  I can tell you that there was a portion of the cash that we took in in the capital raise that was retained at the parent holding company.  Some obviously was used to pay Syncora.  Some was used to pay off the private placement notes.  Some was used to downstream to our subsidiaries.  At September 30, we had about $335 million in what was essentially cash at the holding company.  We\'ve got a similar amount, a little more, in a conservative investment portfolio.  Quite frankly, we have substantial amounts of liquidity in our subsidiaries if there was any need to upstream those to the parent holding company.  The ability to do that is quite flexible, particularly with a Bermudabased company.  We don\'t have any concerns at all about liquidity for the holding company.
Alain Karaoglan  Banc of America
The ability for you to dividend from the subsidiaries to the holding company is quite flexible going forward if you need to do that?
Brian Nocco
Yes.  Not only dividend, which would typically be the form of doing it, but actually loans as well.  We can get cash up to the holding company quite easily.
Alain Karaoglan  Banc of America
In terms of an insurance question, to change a little bit, if there\'s a reserve release $88 million on the reinsurance side.  Could you tell us either which lines of business left to that reserve release?
Brian Nocco
Again, our variety of sources from the reinsurance portfolio, almost 50 percent of it came from some capital gearing structures we did with Lloyd\'s syndicates on a 2005 year of account.  When the RITC calculations took place, we were able to release reserves on that year.  The rest of it was spread, quite a lot, was XL Europe principally in short tail lines.
Alain Karaoglan  Banc of America
Last question on pricing going forward.  If you are going to reduce the risk on investment portfolio, and I assume riskier investments on the P&C side were hopefully expected to earn a higher return.  Does that mean you need to be a little harsher on your pricing and price that you have to charge your customers to achieve your returns on equity goal? 
 
Mike McGavick
We have factored in that we would be operating with a less risky portfolio when we made the statement that we believed we could deliver through the cycle of 15% ROE.  I would emphasize that that 15% ROE is meant to be with respect to the results from our underwriting operations.  We are not including the way in which the alternative portfolio returns to the P&L.  This is a statement about our ability in our underwriting operations and we factored that with lower expectation of investment yield.

Your next question comes from Brian Meredith - UBS.
Brian Meredith  UBS 
Any desire to or can you sell assets to TARP?
Mike McGavick
No.  We don\'t have any desire to or need to.
Brian Meredith  UBS
I was wondering if you could dive into the 74.3% [inaudible] little bit more here.  It was up fairly significantly yearoveryear as well as from the second quarter.  If I remember, the second and first quarter numbers also had some large loss activity as well as the additional reserves from the D&O subprime portfolio.  What exactly is causing the big increase in the loss this quarter?
Dave Duclos
Brian, I would say it\'s a couple of different things.  One is, to a lesser degree, just the earning through of the price decreases which actually have been contemplated in our plan.  Then also, an array of losses that has hit our specialty lines.  And probably, most importantly, a large, several large property individual events.  Not captured in our cat activity.  I mentioned, there\'s a continuation that we saw in the third quarter, which now marks four quarters in a row of whether you call it an increase in noncat property loss activity or not, it\'s clearly having an impact not just on our results, but on many of our competitors.  Those would be the major explanations for that.  As to the other piece that\'s also part of that number is the 1.3%, 1.4% impact from the D&O increase that we mentioned before about the subprime clash exposure.

Brian Meredith  UBS
So we nix out abnormally large property losses.  What kind of loss do you think this quarter has?  The reason I am asking is that if I look at what you actually lost ticket and add your expense ratio, you\'re over 100 combined ratio.
Dave Duclos  
I would say the loss pick, when you take the property impacts out Brian, would be slightly above 70%.  One thing, and Jamie and Mike both mentioned it, in some of our lines, some geographies, we are at that inflection point.  We\'re starting to push prices the other way.  The other comment that I would make is it\'s putting pressure on our combined ratio is the fact that our expenses, because it\'s a nonrecurring cost items in particular and also our decision to invest in operational transformation that we announced in the second quarter.  This pushing that up.  That\'s more of a shortterm pressure.  We think long term that\'s going to prove to be very beneficial as we drive efficiencies up.
Brian Meredith  UBS
Last, could you give us some detail as what lines you\'re seeing upward rate bias?
Dave Duclos
The dominant one continues to be FI within the D&O sector.  But I would also say that we\'re starting to see D&O pricing in other segments as well.  Starting to reflect a change in terms of price attitude.  We\'re hearing some noise, we\'re seeing a little bit in our book.  Not as much as we\'d like, but we\'re hearing of changes upcoming in the marine lines, both on and offshore properties.  I think that\'s a direct relationship to Ike and Gustav impact.  Then, also, selectively, we\'re seeing some rate firming in some of the specialty areas.  The key piece right now is going to be see how the aviation 12/1 renewal plays out.  I can tell you that it\'s certainly not where it was a year ago.  When you continued to see 5% and 10% decreases.

Your next question comes from Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch
The life reinsurance business, can you talk about what the book value of that business was at the end of the quarter?
Brian Nocco
We\'ll be releasing that when the financial supplement is filed.  That hasn\'t been released yet.  Clearly, it will be off a bit because of marks in the portfolio.  But it has not been released yet.
Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch
And then, I think I have asked this question maybe last quarter, given the capital situation, showing the pressure on the investment side, have you rethought your ownership stakes in various hedge funds and alternative investment vehicles that you own?
Mike McGavick
I need to give you a same answer I gave last time.  We are evaluating that portfolio of investments.  We continue to consider what\'s in the best interest of our shareholders and that\'s what I said before and that\'s what we\'re doing now.
Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch
The last question on the market conditions, clearly for you and for everyone, the cost of capital has gone up.  When you think about returns, which obviously you want to exceed your cost of capital, you want all else being equal, higher returns.  Do you have a mandate to your underwriters to start pushing for higher prices due to that factor?
Mike McGavick
We always base our pricing on the realities of our capital situation and the realities of the marketplace and those two things are the logical drivers of how one prices.  We are certainly aware.  It\'s one of the reasons for my comment earlier about our optimism about market conditions.  I will ask if either of the business heads would like to comment further.
Dave Duclos  
What I would add is what I have mentioned before in responding to Brian\'s question, we are actually seeing price actions being driven by the realities, not only our capital, but also some of the expense items that I mentioned earlier.  What you are going to see is the various, variety in terms of price change anywhere from maybe minus 5 to minus 10 in some areas to actually getting increases and getting significant increases as I mentioned before in the FI sector as part of D&O.  I would say as a general observation though, I think there needs to be a broad industry education as to what this cost of capital impact has had.  I think that\'s going to be something that you will probably see play through over the next quarter or two.  From an observation perspective, I don\'t think the industry fully understands how this has been impacting the results.

 
Mike McGavick
I that\'s a very important note.  We\'re not predicting some sudden radical turn.  We just see all of the conditions that cause turn are now present.  One condition I failed to mention earlier that I would also mention now is we\'re also seeing some sign of increased demand, which it seems appropriate to us because people are getting more conservative and protecting their balance sheets.  That makes some sense.  The kind of drive to higher retentions that we were seeing in the reinsurance sector, I suspect, will start to reverse themselves.  We\'re seeing some signs of that already.  It wouldn\'t surprise me, as you get into the 1/1 reinsurance buying cycle, to start to see these greater awarenesses that the increased demand, the missing capital, all of that start to come to play to really put its pressure into the pricing cycle.

Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management.  
Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital Management
I actually had a similar pricing question.  I guess the early reports we\'re getting from risk managers and some of the brokers is that there hasn\'t been much for price response yet.  There\'s a lot of shopping going around, but not much pricing.  If anything, the AIG is being aggressive trying to defend their book, which is somewhat understandable.  I guess the way I am thinking about it is given all the stresses and the cost of capital has gone up, just less capital to go around, if we get the January 1 and prices are where they are today, what\'s your message to the underwriters?  Is it that\'s not good enough, we need more, we\'re not going to write new business, we\'ll just keep what we have.  Or do you say, we wish it were higher, but it\'s okay at least if you can get new business at these prices, it\'s still worth going ahead.
Mike McGavick
First, I would not and will not make any comment on any competitor behavior.  But with respect to the instructions we give our underwriters, I think you need to look no further than our reinsurance top line to know that we are very disciplined with respect to the position we take in the market.  Our top line has been coming down significantly in the reinsurance business.  This because we believe that pricing is inadequate and we stayed to our disciplined approach.  
With respect to the insurance element itself, I believe that the, in insurance, we continue to keep our underwriters focused that we have real targets and those are important targets.  That isn\'t going to change.  If we have to see some shrinkage in order to maintain our discipline, we would.  Something to note, though, why aren\'t we growing?  If that\'s a environment out there?  We have a number of growth strategies that we had announced over the last year.  And they are performing well.  That\'s a part of it.  A part of it is that there\'s a lot of opportunities in this marketplace right now.  Whatever the source.  We\'re going to continue to be one of the people that will be given a chance to look at and quote on that business.  We were seeing that accelerating throughout the quarter as the noise of SCA got behind us and we think as the noise of this rumordriven week of stock performance gets behind us.  We will see that momentum reignite.
Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital Management
Then without asking you to speak directly about a competitor, but D&O line, would seem to be one area that obviously security is very important to the extent there\'s concern about some of your competitors.  Could you just talk about just where your appetite is.  If there were a lot of D&O programs being shopped, do you have the appetite to increase your share materially at the right price?  Or is that a line where you don\'t really want to expand that line too much.

Dave Duclos
I would say at the right price and the right classes, that\'s exactly the business we want to write.  It continues to be one of our most profitable segments both in the U.S. and globally for us.  I would say that we had a very successful 10/1 renewal and new business date.  To Mike\'s point, just prior to some of the at this time from last week relative to our market price or share price dropping, we were very successful and we will continue to look for opportunities.  That\'s part of the business that we would expect to grow as we move forward irregardless of what happens with specific competitors.
Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital Management
Can you remind me what your line size is when you lead a program and again your appetite for expanding line size if necessary in this market?
Dave Duclos
Our line size, we can write up to $75 million, but that\'s very selectively.  I would say the average is around $10 million, $11 million the average limit size.  We do prefer to lead.  We prefer to lead in professional property and casualty lines and we\'ve demonstrated based on the percent of accounts that we do lead on that we\'re pretty successful at that.
Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital Management
Obviously, the S&P news was great.  Best, I don\'t think has commented yet.  Is there anything you can see about conversations with Best?

Mike McGavick
We really can\'t.  We need to let the rating agencies speak for themselves.  We have been in regular communication with all the rating agencies and what they will say is up to them.
David Radulski
Unfortunately, we\'re getting to the market open, little after the market opens.  We have time for one more question.

Your final question comes from Donna Halverstad - Goldman Sachs.
Donna [Halverstad]  Goldman Sachs
Most of my questions were asked, but there was one thing I wanted to ask for a little more color on, it\'s with respect to the continuation of the aboveaverage level of large property losses.  On the face of that, it seems pretty random, but have you taken a deep dive into that to see if there\'s anything at all that looks systematic or that seems to tie those losses together?  Or do you really view it as 100% random?

Dave Duclos  
It would be the latter.  100% random.  Actually, what I think you\'re seeing is a return of more normal loss activity.  From a period of time post KRW, certainly late 2005 into late 2007, we just had no relativity in terms of large property losses.  There\'s no correlation.  There\'s nothing tied to economic conditions.  Frankly, I think what normal might be is between what we\'ve experienced in 2008 and what we saw in 2007.  We have to be prepared and that\'s why I made the comment before.  We can\'t but for these types of losses.  And we have to reflect our pricing and renewal strategies appropriately.
Mike McGavick
Again, obviously, we will never make it a habit to respond to rumors.  This is a very unique time in the marketplace obviously.  We felt that the early announcement of our view of our book value per share as well as our investment results was justified.  We felt it was also justified to have our finance team and the people of PWC working all weekend to try and get more comfortable to make very detailed announcement today.  We felt that, too, was justified.  And obviously, we will have a final release later in the quarter once that work is all complete.  Though obviously, we are very comfortable with these numbers are they wouldn\'t have been out in the marketplace.  That\'s where we are, we look forward to working with you in the months ahead and appreciate your time today.
